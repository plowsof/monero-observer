> *Price/pattern*: XMR/USD opened at ~$240 (Kraken) on August 1st and rose all the way up to ~$339 to form a top; closed around $285 (+18.8%) on the last day of the month; overall we printed a bullish engulfing candle in August, but the bears managed to form a rather large wick to the upside by rejecting the top;

> *Bearish scenario*: if it breaks down in September, we can expect to see a reaction at the $225-$250 levels; further down $175-180 is a good zone to look for stronger support; 

> *Bullish scenario*: if we break $340, then the $518 ATH will be the next big target.

That's it for the 1st *Monero Observer Blitz*.

You can find reference links for everything mentioned above on the site.

Obviously, a lot of stuff is missing as it is virtually impossible to include every single thing that happened this past month. Furthermore, please remember that the **Monero Observer** was only *born* recently, it's still a baby. 

I just hope this was helpful to you. Thanks for reading and make sure you are extra vigilent on that boating trip next month!
