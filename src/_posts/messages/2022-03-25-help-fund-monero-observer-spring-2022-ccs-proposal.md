**Update 22/03/27: fully funded!**

I am very thankful to everyone that contributed:

```
33 contributors raised 27 XMR (100%)
```

If you find Monero Observer helpful and wish to support the project, you can donate any amount to the XMR address listed on the associated **[Spring 2022 (March-May) CCS page](https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/escapethe3ra-monero-observer-maintenance-spring-2022.html)**.

Thanks for your support! 

**escapethe3RA**

*PS: In the unfortunate eventuality that the funding goal is not met, I will still strive to maintain MO for the foreseeable future, keep it cypherpunk and 100% independent.*
