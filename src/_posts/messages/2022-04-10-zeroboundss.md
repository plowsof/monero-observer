> Your main job as a Monero and privacy enthusiast is to call out anyone who stigmatises anonymity and insinuates it's for shady stuff. I wrote a "Manifesto" stating what it stands for and why. Anonymity is a human right. Don't be scared to defend your right to be anonymous with friends and family.
