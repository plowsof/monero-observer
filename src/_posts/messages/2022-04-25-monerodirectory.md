> The website is a Monero directory that showcases services and websites that accept or utilize Monero. I unfortunately do not have time to work on the project and I do believe it has a lot of potential if it is put into the right hands. The domain name is perfect for SEO. The website is very easy to maintain and currently only cost $5 to host a month.
