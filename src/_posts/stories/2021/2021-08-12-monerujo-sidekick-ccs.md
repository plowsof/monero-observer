The Monerujo Team is looking to develop an Android app called Monerujo SideKick.

According to **m2049r**:

> [..] a functional replacement for dedicated Monero hardware wallets. [..] It is a companion app to regular Monerujo. 

> SideKick is in essence a DIY hardware hardware wallet - built on hardware people have lying around (often with broken screens and cameras). Creating a wallet that is safer than just storing keys on a device connected to the internet makes sense.

The first milestone is the Beta version, set for 2021-10-01.

Total funding needed: 179 XMR (to date).

Discuss and support this CCS on Gitlab[^1].

**Update 22/2/13: although the CCS was closed, the project is very close to getting funded through Monerujo's Funding Site (133/179 XMR)[^2].**

**Update 22/2/18: fully funded![^3].**
