The drama around Monero's only salaried *employee*, *ever*, Diego **rehrar** Salazar, seems to be coming to an end with #1776 PR merged[^1].

In case you missed it, here's the open letter[^2] to the Core Team, by **geonic**, the statement[^3] from the Core Team on the issue and **rehrar**'s own resignation plan[^4].

I'm confident everyone has learned a lot from this and hopefully Diego can still contribute to the community in the spirit of Monero, as an individual, like me and you.
