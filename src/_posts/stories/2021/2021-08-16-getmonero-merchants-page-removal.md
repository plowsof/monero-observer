Core Team's **ErCiccione** posted a big thread[^1] on Reddit with the latest updates to the Getmonero.org website.

Probably the biggest one is the removal of the Merchants[^2] page from the site.

Currently new merchants have to submit a pull request and someone with write access to the repository has to review and merge that into master so it will show up on the Merchants page.

As **ErCiccione** put it:

> Adding, removing merchants and in general dealing with requests from merchants is becoming very time consuming and recently started to take a considerable portion of my CCS-funded working hours, at the point that i'm asking myself if it really worth it [..]

The proposed alternative would be to link to external merchant directories instead. You can join the discussion on Github in the issues section of the monero-site repository[^3].
