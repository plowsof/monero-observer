The long wait is over: XMR <-> BTC atomic swaps are now live on mainnet. This[^1] probably is one of the biggest events in Monero history. And it affects Bitcoin as well, obviously.

Monero contributor **Seth**[^2] just completed his first mainnet atomic swap, essentially selling XMR for BTC in a peer-to-peer, trustless and private trade over Tor with the use of COMIT network's open source tools[^3].

You can follow Seth's amazing guide[^4] and start swapping today.

XMR Core **ArcticMine**'s comment[^5] on the implication of combining Bitcoin's upcoming Taproot *privacy* upgrade with the XMR-BTC atomic swap existing funcitonality is at the very least exciting:

> The implication here is that it is not possible to tell on the Bitcoin side that an atomic swap with Monero actually took place. So while Taproot by itself will not make Bitcoin private, Taproot when combined with Monero atomic swaps can throw a real monkey wrench into blockchain surveillance on the Bitcoin blockchain.

The future is now, indeed. Finally some great news.
