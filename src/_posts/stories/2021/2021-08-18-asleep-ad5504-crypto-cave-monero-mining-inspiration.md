**Asleep-Ad5504**[^1] wants to take his mining passion to the next level and inspire others in the process:

> Its setup to hold 256 monero mining machines.

If you are interested, join the conversation[^2] and why not -- give him a hand with the Crypto Cave website[^3] design. 

Provided all goes according to plan, there will be a video series covering the entire mining operation. Cool.
