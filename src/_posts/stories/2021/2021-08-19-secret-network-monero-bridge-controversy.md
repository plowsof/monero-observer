**dror88**[^1] started a whole debate about Secret Network's new Monero bridge[^2] on Reddit[^3].


Here are the main pain points being discussed:

- poor user experience for a mainnet release

- questionable privacy and decentralization, since users apparently need both an email address[^4] to participate and a Discord account in order to open a support ticket, in case you run into trouble

- shady marketing strategies (in a different thread[^5])

Secret Network's Monero bridge promises private access for the Monero community to the Secret DeFi ecosystem, but most of the Monero community seem to be in agreement that the current state of the bridge is unusable by privacy-conscious users. 

**reesie11**[^6]'s comment was pretty clear:

> I would not touch it with a ten foot pole at least for a while until they get kinks worked out (and maybe never).
