**cryptor832**[^1] reported that the 2-day old XMRzone pool[^2] just mined[^3] its first ever Monero block, with only 12 miners.

It's good practice for new miners to join smaller pools in order to maintain a decentralized mining environment for the Monero community.

XMRzone has been added to the Monero Pool List Wiki[^4]. You can see individual pool fees, number of miners, hashrate and other statistics on that same page.
