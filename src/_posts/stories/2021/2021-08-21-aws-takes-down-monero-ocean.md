**wheezybackports**[^1] reported that the 12th biggest Monero mining pool, Monero Ocean[^2]'s primary server has been suspended.

MO admin commented:

> I think they are in the wrong in this situation. In summary I got a warning that I need to resolve some issues 5 days ago and inform them that it is done. I resolved them and informed them and still got this account services suspension. (Without warning before)

Although the service disruption might be temporary, **CharcoalWhite**'s reply[^3] seems to reflect what probably everyone in the community is thinking:

> I think people should learn their lessons from others and NOBODY should ever use AWS. This isn't the first website they've done it to
