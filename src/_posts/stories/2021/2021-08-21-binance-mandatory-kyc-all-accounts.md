Binance is now doing mandatory KYC on **ALL** accounts, according to their latest announcement[^1].

Previously there was a tier that would allow unverified accounts to exist and withdraw up to 2 BTC per day, then a month ago they lowered that amount to 0.06 BTC, and now it all ended with mandatory KYC for everyone on the platform.

As expected, the so-called *Intermediate Verification*[^2] process will force users to submit their personal documents: ID/Driver's License/Passport.

All centralized exchanges have to succumb to regulatory pressure at some point, naturally.

The good news is that you don't have to comply, there are options:

- the Monero community is busy building its own DEX: **Haveno**[^3],

- BTC-XMR atomic swaps are already on the mainnet[^4],

- you can still use the peer-to-peer **Localmonero**[^5] exchange for private fiat and crypto trades,

- and if you need a more complete list just visit **KYCnot.me**[^6].
