**Crypt0-Bear**[^1] started working on a cross-chain atomic swap protocol[^2] between Monero and Ethereum.

> The swap is very similar to the Commit network btc-xmr atomic swaps but differs in that the hashed timelock contract is replaced with an escrow smart contract with built in auto reverse transactions.

> Might need some help when I get to the adaptor signatures part.

A *Draft Proposal*[^3] is available that showcases how the swap process should work. 

To get involved in the development process you can join the *#XMR-ETH-Swaps*[^4] channel on Matrix.
