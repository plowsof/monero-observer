HoodestBuddhist[^1] reported that Coindesk has removed Monero's page from their website for no apparent reason.

The page now returns a *404 - Page Not Found* error[^2]. The WayBackMachine shows[^3] the page was last spotted online and archived on the 14th of August.

No other live price feed page seems to be missing from Coindesk, but Monero's.
