The Monero Observer CCS proposal[^1] has been submitted to the *Ideas* stage. At this point, I am waiting for the community to review it.

If you find this website helpful, please share your feedback on Gitlab and vote to pass the proposal to the *Funding Required* round. 

My proposal is to keep working on the project for the next 3 months: September, October and November 2021. After that we can discuss 2022 plans based on community feedback.

Thank you,

**escapethe3RA**
