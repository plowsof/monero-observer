title: Proposal to deprecate Monero integrated addresses ignites community discussion
description: Localmonero dev proposes to deprecate Monero integrated addresses and the community discussions heat up.

Alex[^1] from LocalMonero[^2] ignited a heated discussion around the pros and cons of deprecating Monero integrated addresses in favor of subaddresses:

> [..] eliminating integrated addresses would further increase the homogeneity of the network (improving privacy), reduce blockchain growth as there will no longer be a need to store payment ID data [..]

t-900-a[^3] suggested a more conservative approach:

> MyMonero, openMonero, monero-lws do not have support for subaddresses. By the time integrated addresses are deprecated a lightweight wallet server should have support for subaddresses.

The community seems to be split 50/50 so far, but it's normal and healthy to have lengthy discussions before reaching consensus in any serios matter that can affect the network.

If you would like to contribute to the discussion, post a comment on Github in issue number #7889[^4].
