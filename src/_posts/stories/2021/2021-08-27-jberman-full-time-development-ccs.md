Justin Berman[^1] is looking for community feedback on his CCS proposal to do full-time development on Monero for the next 3 months, starting August 30 2021. The tasks would include:

- improving the decoy selection algorithm

- performing an informal security audit of *monero-lws*[^2]

- several one-off tasks


Total funding needed: 78 XMR (to date).

Discuss and support this CCS on Gitlab[^3].
