**chiefgyk3d**[^1] shared[^2] some inspiring pictures of his RockPro64[^3] Monero node with a 3D printed case, running PiNodeXMR[^4]:

> So this one also runs over Tor and Itâ€™s about $200 altogether with a RockPro64 4GB, 16GB eMMC for boot, 256 GB NVMe via PCIE x4 adapter for blockchain and a 30mm heat sink with a USB noctua 40mm fan. I used PiNodeXMR on Armbian with some tweaks [..]

The community is impressed.
