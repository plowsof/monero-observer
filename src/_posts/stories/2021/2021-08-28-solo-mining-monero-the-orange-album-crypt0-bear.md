**Crypt0-bear**[^1] just released the latest music video from *The Orange Album*[^2] titled *Solo Mining Monero*[^3].

You can purchase the full album which includes 8 songs for a total of 22 minutes of music delivered in WAV format, for only $10 worth of XMR.

On top of that, you can opt to go the *manual order*[^4] route in order to better preserve your privacy:

>  [..] to better protect the personal identifiable information of our customers, we are able to process orders manually by PGP email and ship the merchandise to our own business address and then re-ship directly to the customer.

Now, that's cypherpunk.

**UPDATE: After the xmr.radio website redesign, some of the links below might not work. You can still support the artist by donating to his XMR address that's listed in the video description section.**
