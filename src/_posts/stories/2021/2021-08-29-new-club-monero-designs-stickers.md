**Club Monero**[^1] added new unique items to their shop this week and their collection currently consists of 20 unique Monero-focused designs on shirts, stickers and more.

Featuring:

- *Monero Extremist*

- *I Lost All My Monero in a Boating Accident*

- *Take the Orange Pill*

- *Come and Trace It*

- *Super Monero*

Mike's message that is posted on the *Mission*[^2] page is an interesting read:

> I consider Monero to be one of the greatest tools for freedom in history. I want more eyes to see the word “Monero”, and I want to affect how it is perceived.
