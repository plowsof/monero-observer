**StableRare**[^1] opened up a debate[^2] in which Cypher Stack[^3]'s relationship to Monero's core team, the General Fund, the community and the CCS process is being discussed:

> What is this companyâ€™s relationship to Monero? Is it collaborative, antagonistic or just a neutral resource for hire? It does seem the Monero project completes with them on occasion for talent and they do work for alternate privacy crypto-projects such as FIRO [..]

> [..] why do some researchers prefer to work through Cypher Stack instead of being funded via CCS process?

Diego *rehrar* Salazar[^4] is the founder[^5] of Cypher Stack. He had to step down from the core team due to controversy, as reported[^6] recently.

Monero Outreach's **geonic_**[^7] slammed the company:

> Their past behavior (referenced below) and continued attempts to poach talent before the community has a chance to fund them directly raises some questions about their professed motives and whether it is a good idea to insert a self-interested third party between the project and its contributors.

And concluded:

> I do not plan to support any future proposals by them, regardless of who will be performing the work.

The community seems to agree that something doesn't feel right:

> Every time they come up they sound shady AF.[^8]

*If Diego or someone at Cypher Stack would like to comment and gets in touch, I will post it here.*
