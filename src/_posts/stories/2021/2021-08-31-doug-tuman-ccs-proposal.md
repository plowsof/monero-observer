Doug Tuman[^1], the host of Monero Talk[^2] is looking to expand his presence in the crypto space and implicitly bringing Monero to a larger audience.

Some of his CCS's proposed milestones are:

> Host people that are known beyond the Monero community in an effort to expand our audience.

> Be a guest on popcasts and radio/tv shows that have a large following outside of the Monero community.

> Start a new show that does daily Monero news updates or incorporate that into MoneroTopia and air it more frequently.


Total funding needed: 240 XMR (to date) over a period of 6 months.

Discuss and support this CCS on Gitlab[^3].
