Haveno[^1] devs have finalized the trade protocol[^2] and are now looking to implement it in the code[^3]:

> Feedback is very welcome and encouraged. Instructions about how to compile Haveno are in the repository. 

Besides testing the software and submitting your feedback, you can also participate in their new *Bounty program*[^4]. Bounties are paid in XMR, naturally.

The team has also updated the official email address from the temporary *havenodex@protonmail.com* to *contact@haveno.exchange*.
