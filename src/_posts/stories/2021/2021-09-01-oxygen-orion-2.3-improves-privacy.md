> This release was the direct result of 16 people who worked, largely unpaid and altruistically, to put out 87 commits containing 838 new lines of code. We'd like to thank them very much for their time and effort. In no particular order they are:


- luigi1111
- dsc
- xiphon
- benevanoff
- moneromooo
- anon
- tobtoht

According to **selsta**[^4], the auto updater will be turned on only after the community submits feedback about this release[^5].

Make sure you check the hashes and signatures before running the new version.
