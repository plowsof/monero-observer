*KYC? Not me!*[^1] is back online after being down for a few months. During that time **pluja**[^2], the project's maintainer, has rewritten the website and added new funcitonality.

Browsing through the minimalist interface, you can find a curated list of non-KYC crypto services and exchanges that have their ToS auto-checked for *for potential-KYC-enforcement words* and each are given a score based on that evaluation.

The project is open source and the code has been migrated from Github to Codeberg[^3]. The website doesn't have any trackers or Javascript, being easily accessible through Tor.

If you wish to be listed on the website, there's a *Listing Request*[^4] section in the README of the official repository that you can follow.

Since this is a self-funded project, community contributions[^5] are welcome. XMR accepted and the first choice, obviously!
