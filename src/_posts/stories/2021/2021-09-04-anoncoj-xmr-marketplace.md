reddit_flaneur[^1] invites[^2] people to join the new AnonCoj[^3] community where Monero enthusiasts can interact with each other and use their XMR to buy and sell goods and services:

> AnonCoj.ch a Monero-alone marketplace based on Agora philosophy. AnonCoj or "Classifieds" in Esperanto is an anonymous place to buy or sell goods and services for monero.

At this point there's not a lot of content and the platform is essentially a forum.
