jonjonbonbonbonbon[^1] shared a few *poems*[^2] with the crypto community. One of the rhymes is about Monero:

> Old Captain Monero did gloat<br>
as he sailed in his forty-foot boat—<br>
‘Just watch! I can steer<br>
while I’m chugging this beer!’<br>
Now he wishes his wallet could float.

His new series is called *CryptODES*, *Poems for the Crypto Community*:

> They’re just silly rhymes for a Sunday afternoon. I hope you like them.
