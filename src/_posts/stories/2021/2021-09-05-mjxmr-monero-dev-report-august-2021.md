Monero contributor **mjxmr**[^1] submitted his August 2021 dev report[^2] for community review. 

His part time coding on Monero Core[^3] was funded by the Monero community with the support of the *General Fund*[^4], via a CCS proposal[^5] for Q3 2021 (3 months) and it involves CI fixes, PR reviews and extending his *Monero health report*[^6]. 

mjxmr's community-funded work on Monero should expire on September 30, 2021.
