xmrSale[^1] payment processor CCS proposal[^2] is looking for funding[^3]. 

Since it has been moved[^4] to the funding stage by luigi1111[^5], the community has contributed more than half of its target, or ~50/82 XMR, within ~24 hours.

According to its anonymous developer[^6]:

> xmrSale is a lightweight Monero payment processor that connects to your own Monero node, striving to be modular and lightweight. xmrSale has an accessible API written in python that talks to your own Monero node, uses RPC to generate new addresses, and monitors payment success with your own copy of the Monero blockchain.

There's also a demo[^7] of xmrSale that the community can explore.

The first milestone is set for this month (September 2021) and we should have a functioning XMR payment processor with node connection and docker image.
