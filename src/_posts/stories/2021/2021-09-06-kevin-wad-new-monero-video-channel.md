Kevin *kwadoss* Wad[^1] just started a brand new channel[^2] where he plans to publish Monero-related videos:

> After thinking deeply about it, I have decided to spread the word about xmr. I will cover everything and make sure Monero gets the light it deserves.

In the first video[^3] he analyzes the upcoming DNA data storage technology and the impact that would have on Monero's scalability.

If you have any feedback for Kevin, you can post it in his Reddit thread[^4].
