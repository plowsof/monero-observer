Doug Tuman[^1], the host of Monero Talk[^2] is looking to work full-time on Monero projects, as reported last week[^3].

After community review and discussions, luigi1111[^4] has moved his CCS proposal[^5] to the *Funding Required*[^6] stage of the process so people can start contributing.

Total raised so far: 52.2 of 240 XMR (as of September 9, 2021).

If you wish to contribute, the XMR donation address is listed on the CCS page[^7] for this proposal.
