Farcaster[^1] developer **h4sh3d**[^2] submitted the BTC-XMR atomic swap implementation progress report for August 2021[^4]. The implementation of core architecture, the second milestone, is close to completion:

> Minimal functionality: at completion-time of milestone 2, all components for executing atomic swaps successfully are implemented using our libraries as proposed in the presented architecture.

At that point ~45% of the entire work will be finished. 

The project was funded by the Monero community via a CCS proposal[^5]:

> Thus I am reaching out to propose getting a team to work on implementing this protocol, with the end goal of creating a production-ready client/daemon for swapping Bitcoin and Monero. Our design enables to seamlessly extend support for more cryptocurrencies to swap with Monero.

You can interact with the Farcaster workgroup on irc[^6]. They hold dev meetings every Wednesday at 12 pm UTC.
