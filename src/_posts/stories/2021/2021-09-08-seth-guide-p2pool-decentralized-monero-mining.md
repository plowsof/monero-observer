Seth[^1] just published a comprehensive guide[^2] that aims to help the community run and mine on a p2pool[^3] node:

> This guide will aim to make it very simple and straightforward for you to start and run your own Monero node and p2pool instance for decentralized and fee-less mining of Monero.

Although the software is mainnet-ready, it is under active development and might still contain bugs. Testing with small amounts might be a good idea.
