XMR Radio[^1] will broadcast the current Monero block[^2] height[^3] every hour via their *Numbers Station* announcement.

You can listen to the community-ran Monero radio through tor[^4] by following the quick guide[^5] on their website.

> The aim of the station is to have a fun way to connect with listeners, while having a platform to disseminate information regarding upcoming Monero updates, new CCS proposals, and any interesting crypto-industry related news.

If you enjoy the experience, you can donate[^6] some Monero to support the project.
