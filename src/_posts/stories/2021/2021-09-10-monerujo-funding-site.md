New *Monerujo Funding Site*[^1] is now online. Users can directly donate to the subaddress of the projects they would like to fund:

-  PocketChange
-  Support multiple colour themes
-  Monerujo SideKick
-  Monero mnemonic seed with offset passphrase
-  Onion support

Everything is transparent as the devs have made the view-only key[^2] for the *Main Donation Fund* wallet file available on the site.

The site uses the *xmr-wishlist-aaS*[^3] backend and Moneroart[^4]'s front-end. Credit goes to twisted_turtles[^5], KnowledgeMurky9635[^6] and m2049r[^7] for the good work on Monerujo[^8].
