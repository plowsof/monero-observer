XMR-Bets[^1] Monero lottery is looking for community feedback.

One lottery ticket costs 0.01 XMR and the transparency of the bets can be verified using the view-only wallet private key.

Winners have to provide the transaction key corresponding to the transaction ID of the draw and the previous draw results[^2] are listed on the website.

Do note that the service is currently centralized and thus you need to place trust in the project's maintainer:

> How can I be sure that you won't steal my money?
	You can't. It is indeed a 100% centralized system. Even worse, right now it is 100% centralized on me 	as I am the only developer of the app and if I die you will probably lose what you sent. So please be 	advised that it is risky and don't YOLO.


You can submit your feedback in the announcement thread[^3].
