Besides the *Numbers Station*[^1] hourly XMR current block height announcement, XMR Radio[^2] have also been broadcasting some random sounds[^3] once per hour:

> 47 114 47 122 98 97 114 101 98

The string above, when decoded, revealed a subreddit:

> r/zbareb[^4]

Several hints were dropped during the *Monero Codenames*[^5] event.

Everything was leading the hunters to the *Wake Up Neo* post[^6]. This linked to a pastebin[^7] containing an XMR wallet seed file and restore height.

XMRscott[^8] was the quickest to solve the puzzle, but having no easy access to an XMR wallet, the 0.09 XMR were snatched by rottenwheel[^9].

According to XMR Radio this will probably not be the last hunt:

> The competition was running for 2-3 days for anyone to come and take it, and there could possibly be more puzzles like this in the future! So please follow xmr_radios twitter and listen in to get a head start on the next one! Fun idea imo!
