*XMRig Made Easy*[^1], a graphical user interface configuration editor for XMRig[^2] is ready for testing.

The dev, garrylachman[^3], has made the software open-source but cautions users this is a very early Alpha version, so errors and broken things are to be expected at this stage.

There's also a demo video[^4] available on Reddit.

Contributors are very welcome:

> If you have experience with React/TypeScript/Electron and you want to contribute - I would love to get help. I have a full time job and so the time resource is limited.

The roadmap[^5] for this project is available on Github.
