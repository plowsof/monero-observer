The next *Monero Development Workgroup* meeting is scheduled[^1] to take place on Sunday, 3rd of October 2021 at 17:00 UTC.

The meeting should take place on irc/matrix[^2] in the #monero-dev channel.

It might be worth also keeping an eye on the associated #monero-gui[^3] channel.

*Seraphis/Lelantus-Spark vs Triptych*[^4] and the consensus changes for the next hard fork should be in focus.
