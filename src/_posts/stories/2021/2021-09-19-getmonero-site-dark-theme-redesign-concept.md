Hammermann09[^1] has been working on a redesign concept[^2] for Monero's website Getmonero.org[^3]:

> [..] the basic idea is that Monero's website looks aged and doesn't provide a very pleasant experience for visitors and users.

For more details, the community can inspect the included Figma file[^4].

While the overall feedback has been positive, the community has outlined several potential problems regarding the proposal:

- added complexity and thus a potentially higher entry barrier for new contributors
- introduction of new security risks (if Javascript is used)
- unwanted bloat that would automatically add to current page loading times, which in turn would leave out a lot of users with poor connections and limited bandwidth
- lack of dedicated resources for testing, review and implementation
- a switch from a light to dark theme might have some psychological implications in how Monero will be perceived

Exactly how a full redesign like this would impact the Monero community, the larger crypto world's views of us and XMR's core cypherpunk values is unknown. 

If you have feedback, post a comment in the Reddit thread[^5].
