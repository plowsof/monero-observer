*p2pool* version 1.0[^1] has been released. Mining on mainnet has started:

> Before you start mining, create a new wallet and don't use it for anything else but mining for privacy reasons - all wallet addresses are public on P2Pool! Only primary wallet address is supported - no subaddresses or integrated addresses.

The following wallets are known to support p2pool:

- Official Monero CLI and GUI v0.17.2.3 and newer
- Monerujo v2.1.0 "Vertant" and newer
- Cake Wallet v4.2.7 and newer
- MyMonero

Before using the software, you should verify the SHA256 sums with SChernykh[^2]'s GPG key[^3].

The README[^4] has valuable information about features, defaults, how pool shares work, build instructions and a short mining guide.

If you need assistance, you can reach out to other p2pool miners on irc[^5].
