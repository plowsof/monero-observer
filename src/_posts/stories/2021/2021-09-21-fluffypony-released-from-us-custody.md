Monero's ex-lead maintainer Riccardo Spagni seems to have been released from U.S. custody, according to his latest public message[^1]:

> I am very pleased that the U.S. court has released me. I am actively working with my attorneys on a way to return to South Africa as soon as possible so I can address this matter and get it behind me once and for all. That’s what I’ve always wanted to do.

It might be worth noting that Riccardo's legal troubles have nothing to do with Monero and are related to alleged crimes which occured ~12 years ago, in 2009-2011. 

one-horse-wagon[^2] put it best:

> Fluffy pony's criminal troubles have nothing to do with Monero. He is accused of embezzlement at a cookie company and failure to appear in a South African court.[^3]

In the end darkstarman[^4]'s comment rings true and hints at closure:

> To all future Monero developers. Please develop anonymously. Stay safe. I wish him the best.[^5]

Hopefully this matter will be resolved swiftly and without further incidents and unnecessary drama.
