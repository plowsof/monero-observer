w1ck3dAF[^1] has challenged[^2] the Monero community to a small stakes poker game on XMR.poker[^3]:

> Looking to organize a small stakes game to test out the site and get some games going. Reply in the comments and let's play!

XMR.poker uses torpoker[^4], an open-source python poker client application that can be used to play Texas Hold'em No-Limit 6-max cash games using XMR as the currency. 

A BTC torpoker site is available at Torpoker.gg[^5].

For XMR there is also a microstakes public server available[^6] where 1 chip = 0.000001 XMR.

Since there are so many different addresses, you might want to verify the authenticity of each link by using the digitally signed cleartext message[^7]. 

Players can join the action by playing in the browser (onion servers available) or using the app. There's also an option to rent a private server	to play with friends and without rake.

Here is a list of features[^8]:

- No registration (XMR address only)
- Anonymous (XMR, tor)
- Low Rake (1%)
- Immediate Withdrawal (10 confirmations)
- No withdrawal fees (only XMR network processing fees)

As with any experimental non-audited code, it is important to proceed with caution and only test it at micro or small stakes.
