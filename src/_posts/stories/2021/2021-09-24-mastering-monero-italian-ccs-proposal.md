Bl5ckj5ck[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2] looking to translate *Mastering Monero*[^3] to Italian:

> Mastering Monero is incredibly helpful. It enriches the frontend side of the Monero ecosystem. I'd like to add the Italian language so that the book can attract also those who wish to read it in their native language.

Proposed italian translations for the first two chapters have been already submitted in PR #109[^4]. He has also contributed translations for Cake Wallet in the past[^5].

Total funding needed: 14 XMR.

ETA: ~3 months.

Milestones: 

- First milestone : ~62 hrs of work with ~12,400 translated words.
- Second milestone : ~62 hrs of work with ~12,400 translated words.
- Third mileston : ~62 hrs of work with ~12,400 translated words.

You can post your comments for this proposal in !251[^2].
