The next Monero Meet[^1] is scheduled to take place tomorrow, Saturday, 25th of September 2021 at 17:00 UTC.

The event will be livestreamed on the Monero Space[^2] video channel.

Justin Ehrenhofer[^3] posted an announcement on the Monero Space forums[^4]:

> This Monero Meet (held approximately every 4 weeks) will feature active members of the Monero community, who will answer questions from others. It will be loosely organized, and it will run about one hour.

The proposed agenda includes:

- Recent Monero news
- How people can contribute
- Current initiatives and progress
- Future developments
- Research lab "office hours"
- Guiding philosophies

Participants can use *OBS/VDO Ninja*[^5] to participate in the livestream.
