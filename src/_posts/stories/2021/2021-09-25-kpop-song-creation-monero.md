knifetobutter[^1] is looking to hire[^2] an artist to create a POP/K-POP song and pay her in XMR:

> Hello, i require the creation of a pop song. Everything from lyric writing, to instruments, to vocals. Female vocals required. Reminiscent of kpop, but written in english. The name of the song is known.

> [..] the song obviously does not need to be top tier.

The plan is to release the finished song into the *creative commons* for anyone and everyone to use freely.

Budget is negotiable, with a suggested price range of 250-700 USD.
