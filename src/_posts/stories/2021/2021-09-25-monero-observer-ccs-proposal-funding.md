**Update: Fully funded! Thanks for the vote of confidence, I appreciate it.**

The Monero Observer CCS proposal[^1] has been moved to the *Funding Required* stage, after community review.

If you find this project helpful and wish to contribute, you will find the XMR donation address listed on the associated CCS page[^2].

Total raised so far: 15.99 of 15.99 XMR (**100%**).

To everyone that contributed so far:

Thank you, I appreciate your support!

*PS: I want to reassure everyone that even if it would be nice to reach the donation goal, I will most probably still do my best to continue maintaining MO regardless of the CCS process outcome.*
