LBRY[^1]'s most popular video app Odysee[^2] is looking to add[^3] Bitcoin tipping to their platform:

> Pretty soon, you'll be able to send and receive tips in Bitcoin as well. Let us know what you think!

Currently they have only implemented cash and LBRY Credits (LBC)[^4] token tipping.

However, they probably did not expect the overwhelming support for Monero in reply to their announcement.

Literally all top and most upvoted comments are casting a vote of confidence for XMR over BTC:

> What about monero?[^5] -@james_matadobra

> Why not Monero tipping?[^6] -@marksolstafir

> Fantastic! Edit: how about Monero? A bit off topic but a draft upload feature would be awesome too![^7] -@Vault_13

> I'm kinda shocked at how much specific monero asking there is. I guess Monero is a legitimate next option.[^8] -@willstark53

> BTC is okay, I would highly support Monero for maximum privacy![^9] -@leonlagrey

> Monero?[^10] -@paulietoes
