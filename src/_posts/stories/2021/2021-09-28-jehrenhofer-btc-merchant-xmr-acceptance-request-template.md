Justin Ehrenhofer[^1] shared[^2] a template[^3] for cold emailing merchants who already accept Bitcoin but don't accept Monero yet:

> Hello <>, I notice that you accept Bitcoin as payment for your services. Increasingly, merchants whose customers care about privacy accept payments and donations in Monero (XMR). [..] Adding support for Monero isn't just you adding any other coin; it's the world's most used private digital payment option. Thanks, <>

You can use Justin's gist, build on top of it or just create your own from scratch and share it with the community.
