**Crypt0-bear**[^1] has shared a new and improved *Awesome Monero*[^2] curated list of links and useful resources:

> I started a new version of the Awesome Monero list since the old one was ancient

This is a work in progress and more stuff will be added to the list soon.

It currently includes links to the official Monero websites, Git repositories, developer guides, docs, communities, wallets, mining pools, block explorers and XMR exchanges.
