janostrowka[^1] is looking to sell[^2] a *Mellow Board Surfer*[^3] plus an extra battery for XMR:

> The board I am selling is a Mellow Board Surfer. I have ridden only a few kilometers on it, and it is in a great shape. It provides fast acceleration, and rolls smoothly, even over bumpy roads. 

Included in the box:

```
MELLOW DRIVE (all modes unlocked)
FRONT TRUCKS + FRONT WHEELS (80mm)
SURFER DECK made by buddy buddy (perfect for cursing)
2x BATTERY PACKS
STANDARD CHARGER
MELLOW REMOTE
skate tool
ORIGINAL BOX
```

You can see all the images, payment methods and shipping details in the original post[^2].
