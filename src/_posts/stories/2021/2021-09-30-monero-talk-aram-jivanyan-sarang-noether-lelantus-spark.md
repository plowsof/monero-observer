In this episode[^1], Douglas Tuman interviews cryptographers Aram Jivanyan[^2] (from Firo[^3]) and Aaron Feickert (Sarang Noether) about their recently published Lelantus Spark paper[^4].

Active protocol development, differences between Monero and Firo, identity and privacy coins in general are being discussed.

The Monero community is currently looking into[^5] potential alternatives to Triptych. Seraphis/Lelantus Spark is on that list.
