Monero enthusiast and creator of *UnstoppableSwap*[^1] binarybaron[^2] has submitted a CCS proposal[^3] to develop a XMR-BTC atomic swap desktop GUI prototype:

> There are several swap providers active on the mainnet right now. Trustless cross-chain trades are becoming a reality.
While the swap-cli developed as part of the MVP is usable and indeed works, it is not suitable for use by non-technical people who don't have experience navigating the command line.

The software will be a free and open source Electron[^4] app, with releases planned for Linux, Windows and macOS.

The Rendezvous[^5] protocol and Tor integration should come after *the basic functionality is reasonably stable*, according to binarybaron.

```
Total funding: 52 XMR (45 mvp + 4 tor + 0.5/mo for 6 months maintenance).

ETA: 3-4 months (+ TBD, tor integration).
```

Consult MR !257[^3] to share your feedback, ask questions, support this proposal and see exactly what binarybaron plans to focus on if this proposal gets funded.

**Update 21/11/1: the proposal was fully funded.**

**Update 22/4/24: mainnet demo available[^6].**
