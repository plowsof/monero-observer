plowsof[^1] has completed the first ever bounty on the new *Monero Bounties*[^2] platform by setting up a *Monero Dev List* website[^3]:

```
Payout criteria:

- Website code published
- Domain purchased
- At least 10 Monero developers listed on the website

Total Bounty: 0.28005 XMR
```

The site should be deployed live on Monerodevs.org soon. Until that happens you can access the example[^4] on plowsof's Github repository.

To be listed on the website you need to:

1. Fork the repository[^3]
2. Create a file in the `people`[^6] folder (ie. `escapethe3ra.json`[^7])
3. Edit the file to include your own details (you can use my file as an example)
4. Submit a Pull Request[^8]

That's it. Now you have to wait for manual approval.

If you have any questions or encounter issues, consult the README[^5] and get in touch with plowsof[^1].

To create your own bounty, visit the Monero Bounties website[^9].

plowsof has also created `xmr-wishlist-aaS`[^10], which helps anyone access XMR funding. Monerujo[^11], XMR.Radio[^12] and MoneroArt[^13] all used the open source code to create their own funding pages.
