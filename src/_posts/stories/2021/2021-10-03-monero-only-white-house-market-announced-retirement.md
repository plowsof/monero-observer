White House Market[^1] admin *Mr. White*[^2] has announced their upcoming voluntary retirement in a GPG-signed message posted on Dread[^3]:

> We have reached our goal and now, according to plan, it's time to for us to retire.

> We will keep the market online for a limited time until open orders are finalized, disputes handled and coins withdrawn. We don’t know how long that will take but don’t expect to come back 6 months from now and find the market up.

> Thanks everybody for your business, trust, support and of course for placing decent amounts of money in our pockets. We may come back some time in the future with a different project or we may not. Meanwhile be on the lookout for phishing or copycats, if it’s not signed by us it’s not us.

> Good luck and stay safe.

WHM is one of the few major darknet marketplaces that have actually managed to retire in a rather *responsible* manner.

Here are some stats[^4]:

- opened 24 August 2019 (~2.5 years of activity)
- almost 900K users (300K+ active)
- ~3.5K vendors
- close to 50K listings

If and how exactly this event will impact Monero is anybody's guess.
