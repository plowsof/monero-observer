Willing_Astronaut430[^1] has succesfully *tracked* a Bitcoin Cash transaction ID[^2] in less than 12 hours and collected the associated $20 XMR bounty[^2] from fatalglory[^3]:

> Ladies and gentlemen... we have a winner! DM me an XMR address to claim your prize. The answer was d9c4ec5129eea9c58e28d3e5b646065f2e26808bc1dcd19f6484e7ae9b7fa62f.

> That's alarming. It took less than 12 hours for someone to win it! I would be MOST appreciative if you could tell me what led you to the right TX?

According to the winner, it took a lot less than 12 hours to accomplish this:

> I found it with I would say less than an hour of my time. And really it’s more about the community than the money I wouldn’t mind if I wasn’t paid.

He assures the community that more details about the methods he used to find the correct transaction ID will be released soon:

> It’s was relatively easy and simple and I must say I’ve never worked with the BCH blockchain before. I perhaps cheated in a sense it was not purely chain analysis. I will post a more detailed guide of my working tonight [..]

**UPDATE: Willing_Astronaut430 shared[^4] his details about his *detective work* today.**
