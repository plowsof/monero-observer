Distinct_War_353[^1] is looking to buy[^2] some Amazon gift cards with XMR:

> Hey everyone, if anyone is interested in getting some monero, please let me know and we can do a trade for amazon gift cards (US). I can do up to around 150 worth of gc rn.  

Preferably the gift cards should be physical, with a receipt. The trader proposes the exchange to take place on LocalMonero in order to benefit from their escrow service:

> Anyway, If you are interested, please comment, then dm me. Then I'll Link you to my LM profile.

Potential traders should read the *AutoModerator* warning message[^3], do their own research and always make use of an escrow service.
