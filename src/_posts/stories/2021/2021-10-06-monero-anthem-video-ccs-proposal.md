Litesh Gumber[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2] to create a video for the already released *Monero Anthem*[^3] song:

> We are looking to create a video for the already released audio of the Monero Brand anthem. The video will be created in 4k quality. You can refer to the example of our work from the following Polygon.

*Cryptic Entertainments* past work include a Polygon video[^4] and a trailer for the upcoming *#INDIAWANTSCRYPTO* documentary[^5]:

> After the video for Monero, we are looking to create a documentary for Monero. It will cover the entire journey of the project along with the impact it created on the world.

```
Total funding needed: 20 XMR.

ETA: TBD.
```

Consult MR !259[^3] to see the lyrics of the song, the team behind the project and their video equipment.
