MoneroBrasil.org[^1] maintainer and Monero contributor netrik182[^2] has submitted a CCS proposal[^3] looking to substitute ErCiccione[^4] as the new Monero Localization Workgroup[^5] coordinator:

> ErCiccione has been the manager of this workgroup for a long time (see their proposals at the bottom) and recently has been looking for someone to take on these responsibilities as they are focusing their time on other projects now (e.g. Haveno).

netriks182's previous contributions are displayed on his Weblate[^6], Gitlab[^7] and Github[^8] profiles. He has also helped with Monerujo[^9] and LocalMonero[^10] translations.

> ErCiccione will keep managing the backend side of things (update Weblate, bug issues, etc). I will maintain the languages on Weblate, help and find translators, update the documentation, etc. as highlighted above.

Some of the main responsibilities as MLW manager would include:

- managing translators on Weblate and Github for the official website, the user guides, both CLI & GUI wallets
- maintaining documentation on different repositories
- coordinating chat-rooms, attending #monero-community meetings and issuing monthly progress reports to the community
- taking care of eventual translation-related CCS proposals

If this CCS proposal is approved by the community, netriks182 will probably first look to revamp the current CCS proposal process for translators by *enforcing* some rules on who can contribute translations to Monero:

> I want to focus on defining and enforcing some basic rules for translation-related CCS's in the future, accepting work from:

> Translators with a provable portfolio as professional translators

> Contributors of the Localization Workgroup that have a track record of delivering high quality translations (work that has been reviewed by others and deemed of high quality, for example)

> We plan to establish a hybrid approach in which community members could contribute if they wanted to (as volunteers or paid work) given the rules above and in case we fail to meet the above requirements for any given language a.k.a. these contributors do not exist or are of bad quality, they could be replaced with professional resources.

It is unclear if/how new *nonprofessional* translators that are looking to contribute privately to Monero would fit the proposed new system.

```
Total funding: ~11 XMR (20 hrs/wk * 4 weeks @ 30 EUR/hr).

ETA: 1 month (trial).
```

Consult MR !260[^3] to see the milestones, submit your feedback, ask any questions and support the proposal.
