QuickBASIC[^1]'s P2Pool post[^2] was recently merged[^3] by luigi1111[^4] and is now live on the official Getmonero.org blog[^5]:

> Monero P2Pool is a peer-to-peer Monero mining pool developed from scratch by SChernykh (also known as sech1). P2Pool combines the advantages of pool and solo mining; you still fully control your Monero node and what it mines, but you get frequent payouts like on a regular pool.

Several questions about P2Pool are addressed, including how it works, its features and what benefits one would get from using the software.

The article has been approved after being reviewed by several Monero contributors over the past few weeks, including: erciccione[^6], SamsungGalaxyPlayer[^7], hyc[^8] and P2Pool's dev SChernykh[^9].

P2Pool's latest release is currently v1.1. Consult the repository[^10] for release notes, usage instructions and SChernykh' GPG key.
