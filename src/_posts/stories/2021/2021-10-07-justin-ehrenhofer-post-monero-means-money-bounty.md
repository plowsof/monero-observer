Justin Ehrenhofer[^1] has proposed a bounty[^2] for a *Monero Means Money* website[^3] redesign:

> At the moment, the website for https://moneromeans.money lives on Google Sites. Yuck. I would much rather this exist on an open source (and liberally licensed) GitHub website.

> If you can design a better, simple, 1-page website that would work well for Monero Means Money, I would love to switch it over. This just is likely to continue falling by the wayside in terms of my priorities.

To get involved, post a comment on the website expressing your interest in completing the task.

You can also donate to this bounty. So far no one has contributed any XMR to this bounty.

*Monero Bounties* is a new project that was announced[^4] ~1 week ago.

**Update: [new website is now online](/new-monero-means-money-website).**
