Core team's binaryFate[^1] has returned the funds that were accidentally[^2] sent by xorqq to Monero's *General Fund*[^3] address:

> After donating some money to the general fund for Monero, when sending all my money to myself, I accidentally pasted the donation address. I feel like Im gonna have a heart attack [..] 
First time I've cried in years [..]

The issue was resolved in less than 24 hours:

> My issue with accidentally sending my entire XMR balance to the fund has been resolved. Thanks a lot to binaryFate, and thanks to the entire team and volunteers for developing Monero. You guys rock.
