Monero contributor selsta[^1] has submitted a new CCS proposal[^2] to work part-time on Monero development for 3 more months:

> Work for 30 hours per week over the next 3 months [..]

> If funded I will provide monthly updates in the CCS comment section.

He plans to focus on preparing the next network update, releasing v0.17.3.0 with P2Pool changes and other smaller dev work on the CLI and GUI. 

selsta has contributed over 470 merged commits to both the CLI[^3] and GUI[^4] codebases since 2018 and has recently joined Monero's *Vulnerability Response Team*[^5].

The third and last milestone of his previous CCS proposal[^6] will probably be completed by mid-October.


```
Total funding needed: 75 XMR (EUR 45/hr * 30 hrs/week * 3 months).

ETA: mid-January 2021 (3 milestones).
```

You can post your comments and support this proposal on Gitlab in !261[^2].

**Update: the proposal was fully funded.**
