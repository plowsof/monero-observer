Monero contributor mjxmr[^1] has submitted his September 2021 dev report[^2] for community review:

> I'm writing with a bit of delay, since I didn't have enough time for Monero in the 2nd half of September. 

> I have done the usual CI fixes and a few minor reviews, but I believe, that the highlight of the month would be my updated health page, published under http://cryptog.hopto.org/monero/health. 

mjxmr's CCS-related work on Monero should resume in December:

> I thank everybody for your feedback, cooperation and funding. As stated initially, I had to prolong the work period, because of some real life issues. They're all only halfway done, so I will need to make a break in this month and November, and really hope to restart working in full steam, starting from December.

> Until then, I will perform my duties of maintaining my branches, replying to my reviewers and continuously generating my health reports.

His part time coding on Monero Core[^3] was funded by the Monero community with the support of the *General Fund*[^4], via a CCS proposal[^5] for Q3 2021 (3 months) and it involves CI fixes, PR reviews and extending his *Monero health report*[^6].
