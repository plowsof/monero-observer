tabletoe[^1] is looking to hire[^2] a network specialist to help setup his LAN securely:

> I am looking for someone that knows alot about networking and firewalls using linux, pfsense experience a plus.

> A. I am trying to isolate my personal routers 1 and 2 and personal devices from my roommates devices (npdevices) and isp router. 

> B. pRouter1 has a vpn which I will eventually turn on to secure my pdevices and prouters. 

Budget is negotiable and payment is XMR-only:

> Name a price for this small tutoring contract. Edit1: payment only in monero.
