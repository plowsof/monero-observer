Monero contributor ErCiccione[^1] has submitted a new CCS proposal[^2] to work part-time on the Getmonero.org website for 3 more months:

> I'm proposing to continue my part time work on Getmonero.org (monero-site repository), 20 hours a week for 3 more months worth of work. This is a flexible ccs proposal: The 3 months of work will not be done linearly as done up to now, but they will be distributed according to my availability. 

> Note that i still want to complete the work on the moneropedia soon, so at least initially i will work as done until now and the flexible part of this ccs will start later on.

Although he plans to focus more on the development of Haveno[^3], work on items from his previous proposal[^4] will continue:

> > I'm in the process of offloading some of my most time-consuming responsibilities in the Monero project, so that i will be able to dedicate more time to Haveno and other offline matters.

- Triaging issues
- Adding new functionalities according to the feedback of the community
- Increasing user friendliness
- Updating obsolete sections
- Improving localization process
- Bug fixes
- Reviews

ErCiccione's previous contributions[^5] can be viewed in the *monero-site* repository on Github and in his progress update threads on Reddit[^6].


```
Total funding: 33 XMR (USD 30/hr * 20 hrs/week * X months).

ETA: TBD (flexible).
```
