The *XMR Community Art Fund*[^1] is demonstrating[^2] how livestream Monero donations notifications can work on Twitch using the Streamlabs API[^3] and *Apprise*[^4] open-source code:

> The qr code displayed is for the main address for the XMR Community Art Fund

> If you leave a tip you should see on the live stream the amount that you tipped.[^5]

All tips are also displayed on their Twitter account[^6].

*XMR Community Art Fund* uses plowsof[^7]'s *xmr-wishlist-aaS*[^8] open-source code to access Monero funding.

Donations sent to the main address will go towards the most popular ideas, but the community can also vote for a specific design by donating to the associated XMR subaddress:

    On a romantic date
    Walking doggirl Wownero-chan on a leash
    Headpatting Wownero-chan
    Sitting on a throne
    Dressed as a miner / mining

Finished commissions are listed on the website[^1].
