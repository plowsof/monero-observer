XMR.ru[^1] mod and Monero contributor v1docq47[^2] has shared his CCS[^3] progress report[^4] with the community. This covers his activity for the past two months (August-September 2021):

> This is my monthly progress report (CCS.html) + XMR.RU). Below is a list of what has been done and translated into Russian for two months of my work.

He has created video (tutorials and news) for the russian Monero community and translated several documents, including MRL papers, Monero Addresses Cheatsheat, logs from 2 Monero Community Workgroup Meetings and other Monero-related news articles.

A more complete list of v1docq47's Monero contributions can be found on Trello[^5] and Weblate[^6].
