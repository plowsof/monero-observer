xmrSale[^1]'s anonymous developer[^2] has shared a demo store[^3] that uses a functioning Monero WooCommerce plugin:

> [..] we're running a demo store now on https://store.xmrsale.org 

The first progress report (September 2021)[^4] for the associated CCS proposal[^5] was submitted recently, marking the first milestone complete:

- deployed xmrSale website (WIP)[^6]
- packaged Docker container[^7]
- xmrSale instant payments and WooCommerce plugin working

> Still testing the docker image in various setups, and I'm currently going over the docker networking with someone to vet it before we make it a recommended install method. Once this is complete, I'll look for a VPS that offers a 1-click container installs so basically anyone can start accepting Monero.

The next progress report can be expected after the second milestone is completed, potentially in December:

> We're about ~1 week behind getting all the bits together for the second milestone complete as the CCS was only funded recently, but we look forward to really improving the user experience with new docs and revised UI (WIP tacking on to milestone 2).
