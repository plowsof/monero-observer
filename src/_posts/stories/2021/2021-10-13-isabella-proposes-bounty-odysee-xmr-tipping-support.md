Isabella has proposed a bounty[^1] for Odysee to support XMR tipping on their website:

> This is a bounty specifically intended for Odysee the commercial entity to support Monero tipping on their website.

> This bounty will provide an additional financial incentive for Odysee to prioritize development of this feature.

Last month Odysee announced Bitcoin tipping support[^2] but the community overwhelmingly voted for Monero instead[^3].

The bounty will expire if Odysee does not add XMR tipping to their platform in the next 12 months:

> "After one year of no shown progress the funds raised for *expired bounties will be transfered to the top 5 bounties on the site that have the most funding at that time."

You can support this proposal by donating some XMR to this bounty[^1].
