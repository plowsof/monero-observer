*Monero Means Money*[^1] documentary film[^2] has been moved from Google Sites to Github Pages and it has a new open-source code base[^3]:

> Monero Means Money now has a new website at https://moneromeans.money! 

> There are some small things to clean up, but thanks escapethe3RA for creating this website for us! -SamsungGalaxyPlayer[^4]

I have replaced Youtube with Invidio.us video embeds for some added privacy and released the code under MIT license[^5]. You can donate some XMR to yewtu.be and other Invidio.us instances if you wish to support them[^6].

Translations will be added soon, according to ErCiccione[^7].
