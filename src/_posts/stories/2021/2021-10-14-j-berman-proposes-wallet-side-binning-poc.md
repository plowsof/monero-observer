j-berman[^1] has proposed[^2] a wallet-side *binning* proof-of-concept for the decoy selection algorithm:

> This is a simplified approach to "binning" done purely in the client. It's meant to demonstrate a PoC that can be implemented in wallet2 today, while iterating toward a space-saving solution described in @UkoeHB's #84 [..]

Binning has been discussed extensively in several MRL meetings and Gitub issues (#84[^3], #86[^4]). You can learn more about it in the *MÃ¶ser et al section 6.2*[^5] paper.

Comments, reviews and critique of the proposed algorithm can be posted in #88[^2].
