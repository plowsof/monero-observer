Belgium-based Easymonero[^1] crypto exchange is looking for feedback[^2] from the Monero community:

> Easymonero is trying to offer a new way, easier and shorter to get your first Monero. (Our mission is to make Monero acquisition easier for beginners)

> Looking forward to hearing your feedback (bugs, experiences, how to make the process easier,..), and improve easymonero.com

Users can buy XMR by funding the account with a credit card (Visa, Mastercard and Maestro) or via a SEPA transfer. Monero is sent directly to the user's wallet.

Here are some relevant details about Easymonero:

- Easymonero is a product of *Gads Media Group SRL*[^3]
- Fees are 2.5% on float orders and 3% on fixed orders
- Minimum $5, Maximum $10K orders
- No KYC for orders under $55
- Easymonero uses BUSD (BEP-20) to stock (on BSC) user balance value in $ in the app	

Their association with Binance/BUSD will probably be questioned by the community.
