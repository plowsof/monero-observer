*P2Pool* version 1.2[^1] has been released with a couple of important fixes and improvements:

- Mined blocks are submitted to monerod as soon as possible (1-3 ms faster compared to previous versions) to reduce orphan rate

- Reduced overall memory usage after running for a long time

- Fixed possible sidechain split during RandomX epoch change

Before using the software, you should verify the SHA256 sums with SChernykh[^2]'s GPG key[^3].

The README[^4] has valuable information about features, defaults, how pool shares work, build instructions and a short mining guide.

If you need assistance, you can read the FAQ[^5] and reach out to other P2Pool miners on irc[^6].
