Difficult-Outside350[^1] has shared a step-by-step guide[^2] for BTC-XMR atomic swaps using COMIT[^3]'s `swap`[^4] tool:

> This post is for people like me - people who kinda-sorta-maybe generally know what they're doing but are approaching atomic swaps for the first time - to have all the information I've gleaned in one place in a handy step-by-step guide.

This guide doesn't cover the *Automated Swap Backend*. To learn how you can become a market maker and sell XMR for BTC you can consult the `ASB` README[^5].
