Monero contributor mjxmr[^1] has submitted a new CCS proposal[^2] to work on Monero Core[^3] part-time for 3 more months:

> In the same way as previously, I propose to work for 3 months, spending 30 hours a week on Monero Core [..]

> In Q4, I am able to realistically spend 30 hours a week on Monero. I arranged everything so, that the Q4 and January will be easy on me, so I won't have to prolong the work (and payment) like I had to do it in Q3. I'd like to start in November.

His work should focus on the following topics:

- statistical simulation
- addressing user issues
- enabling and helping new developers
- code reviews
- CI fixes
- extending Monero health report[^4]
- adding Monero-GUI to the health report
- general firefighting, whatever problems we face in near future

> Since this question would surely appear: the simulation part shall be open sourced.

mjxmr has contributed 73 merged commits[^5] to Monero Core since 2020. More details about his work can be found in his previous proposal[^6]'s progress report[^7].

```
Total funding needed: ~72 XMR (45 EUR/h * 30 h/week * 4 weeks * 3 months / 220 XMR/EUR).

ETA (period): 3 months (November - January 2021).
```

To share your feedback, ask questions and support this proposal, consult !266[^2].

**Update:**

- added Rucknium collaboration details[^8]
- added clarification: statistical simulation will be open sourced[^9]
- moved to *Funding Required*[^10]
- fully funded[^11]
