The next Monero Research Lab[^1] meeting is scheduled to take place on Wednesday, October 27 2021 at 17:00 UTC.

The meeting should take place on IRC[^2] and Matrix[^3] in the #monero-research-lab channels.

This hasn't been announced yet on Github and other platforms, but it has been confirmed in today's MRL meeting[^4].

In the same meeting, the community seems to have reached consensus for implementing a 16 ring size in the next hard fork[^5].

**Update: Meeting confirmed, issue with agenda added[^6].**
