*Privacy* email providers are very, very few (if any, really). I have been using cTemplar[^1] as the main account for this project, but repeated DDOS attacks have caused prolonged service disruptions[^2] recently.

Email itself is broken. No news there.

Although we might still be forced to use email to sign up for most services, that doesn't mean it is the best option for private communications.

That leaves the door open to the best alternative to emails I could find: **XMPP**.

From now on, **all contact inquiries can be sent to my XMPP address** listed on the [/about](/about) page and included in the [/contact-signed.txt](/contact-signed.txt) signed file.

Other contact methods listed in that file are still valid. Use them if you're having issues with XMPP.

In the future I plan to self-host a Monero Observer community XMPP chat server. 


What do you think? 

As always, any feedback is appreciated. Send me a message on XMPP and try to use a client with OMEMO[^3] support.
