Haveno[^1] is looking for an experienced UI developer[^2] to work in exchange for XMR. Optimal skill set should include:

- experience building well-designed #ReactJS apps with #Typescript
- experience as lead dev of a UI app
- familiar with open source and collaborative development
- experience leading a small group of UI developers (2-3 people)

> The #React app should use modern technologies and patterns which are supported and easily maintained by community members into the future, accounting for accessibility. The app will communicate to the Haveno daemon through #gRPC APIs.[^3]

Applications can be sent via email[^4]. To chat with other Haveno devs, join IRC(Libera)/Matrix[^5].

Several bounties[^6] are also available for working on Haveno. Tor v3 integration[^7] is the latest one, worth $400 in XMR.

**Update 10/22** 

**Job still available:**

> Reminder that the lead UI dev will work 100% remotely and will be paid in #Monero! If you are a #ReactJS developer with experience as leader of a small group of developers, contact us![^8]
