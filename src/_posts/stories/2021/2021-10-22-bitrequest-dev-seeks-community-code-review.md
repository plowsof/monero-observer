Bitrequest[^1] developer[^2] is seeking community assistance[^3] to test and review the code base[^4] of the app:

> Would be nice if it get's some user testing and peer reviewing by the community. The code is on github and it's directly hosted from there (All front-end Jquery/javascript).

The app has no fees, doesn't require any KYC and there's no middleman. 

Potential use cases:

- Point of Sale.
- Send cryptocurrency payment requests to your friends.
- Integrate in your webshop (Beta).

> You can use it to accept monero at your store, bar or restaurant or to send payment-requests to your friends!

> It's really a non profit project to boost adoption [..]

Features include:

- XMR Integrated addresses
- Point of Sale
- Create payment requests by entering the amount in crypto or fiat.
- Share payment requests pegged to fiat to reduce volatility.
- Get instant payment feedback.
- Manage requests (Monitor, View details, Archive).
- Supports multiple cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Nano, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin-cash, Monero and Erc20-tokens).
