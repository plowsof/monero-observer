Kevin Wad[^1] has urged the Monero community to withdraw all XMR from centralized exchanges in his latest video[^2], after sharing what he calls *alarming proof of shady practices* on Binance involving *paper Monero*:

> I'm calling everyone in the community to do the necessary: retrieve your Monero from exchanges [..] 

In this video he analyzes the XMR liquidity crisis[^3] by connecting Binance's purchase[^4] of India's WazirX[^5] platform to their *Rapid Listing Initiative*[^6] and theorizes on why they had to eventually suspend Monero withdrawals[^7].

> [..] it's not a question anymore of whether or not they [Binance] are doing shady things against the interests of Monero holders, it is obvious.

Monero Matteo[^8] points out[^9] that this looks similar to a fractional reserve operation:

> So many great points made here man. The Binance-Wazir connect with the rapid listing - which screams fractional reserve shenanigans.


It can't hurt to withdraw XMR from CEXs to your own wallet. If Kevin is wrong in his analysis, you lose nothing. If he is right, you might win everything. 

The popular saying **not your keys, not your coins** seems to be the appropriate *echo* here.
