CryptoGrampy[^1] has proposed a bounty[^2] for the creation of a FOSS Android APK GUI miner application that supports XMRig:

> While there are a few apps out there of varying quality and up-to-dateness with regard to XMRig, there aren't any apps that allow users to easily provide their on XMRig config, and don't take any percentage off the top.


Minimum requirements include:

- Provide an open-source, completely user buildable Android APK written 
- Should allow users to Start, Stop, and set # CPU cores for mining
- Can functionally work when pointed at various pools: MoneroOcean and P2Pool as mandatory examples
- Does not include a hard-coded donation
- Is free to download in all stores

The payout criteria:

- Code is open-sourced
- Demo of the miner
- Miner can be built / tested by community member

To start working on the project yourself, you should make your intentions public by posting a comment in the bounty's thread[^2].

Alternatively you can contribute some XMR to the bounty address posted by the *Monero Bounties Bot*. Your donation will be reflected in the comments.


```
Total Bounty: ~3.8 XMR (Dec 14, 2021)
```
