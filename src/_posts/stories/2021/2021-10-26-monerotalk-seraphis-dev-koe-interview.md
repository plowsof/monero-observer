In this Monero Talk episode[^1]'[^2], Douglas Tuman interviews Monero contributor Koe[^3].

The discussion touches on a wide range of topics which include his latest work on Seraphis[^5], the upcoming ring signature size increase to 16[^6], Lelantus-Spark and Triptych, the paper Monero theory[^7] and where he found the inspiration to co-write both editions of *Zero to Monero*[^8].
