coinstudent2048[^1] has shared[^2] a series of elliptic curve cryptography beginner tutorials[^3] in Python 3:

> These tutorials are made with Monero (XMR) cryptocurrency in mind (but not too much). However, the ubiquity of elliptic curve cryptography means that these tutorials must also be applicable to other cryptocurrencies.

The license is GPL 3.0 and the elliptic curve prototype `dumb25519.py` is based on Sarang Noether's skunkworks[^4] and Lelantus Spark Prototype[^5].

To start just download or clone the repository locally and run the python files.
