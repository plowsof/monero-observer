*P2Pool* version 1.3[^1] has been released and it features faster block verification and includes the latest *monerod* version:

- Updated monerod to the latest official release-v0.17 code (improved monerod stability)
- Faster block verification, much faster on Linux/MacOS builds
- Decode custom user from stratum client, display stratum client+user on SHARE FOUND and client mainchain found message
- Increase outgoing connections to 10
- Added console command peers to show connected peers
- Disable console quick-edit mode on Windows (auto-select on mouse click)
- Show uptime in status output
- Added --no-color command line option
- Small bugfixes and optimizations

Before using the software, you should verify the SHA256 sums with SChernykh[^2]'s GPG key[^3].

The README[^4] has valuable information about features, defaults, how pool shares work, build instructions and a short mining guide.

If you need assistance, you can read the FAQ[^5] and reach out to other P2Pool miners on irc[^6].
