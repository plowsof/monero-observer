Kevin Wad[^1] explains Monero's liberating role in keynesian economics models[^2] in his latest video[^3]:

> [..] the people do not realize it yet, but the Monero community - we have the duty to be up to the challenge and to give this freedom to the people.

He goes into the Kulaks[^4] collectivisation, the proposed tax[^5] on unrealized capital gains, rising inflation and how Monero is the cypherpunk solution.
