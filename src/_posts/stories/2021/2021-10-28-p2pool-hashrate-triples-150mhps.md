P2Pool's hashrate has tripled[^1] (from ~50MH/s to ~150Mh/s) in less than 24 hours after v1.3[^2] was released. 

At the same time, minexmr[^3], the largest Monero mining pool, has lost approximately 100Mh/s of hashing power.

It is reasonable to speculate[^4] that one or more miners have moved from minexmr to P2Pool within this timeframe.

The network's total hashrate[^5] sits around 2.8Gh/s currently.
