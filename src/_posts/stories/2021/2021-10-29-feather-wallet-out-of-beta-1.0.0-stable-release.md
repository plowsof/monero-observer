Feather[^1] wallet has released stable version 1.0.0[^2] and is out of Beta after 1.5 years of development:

> It is my great pleasure to announce the first stable release of Feather Wallet. This release is the culmination of nearly 1.5 years of full-time developments efforts.

Lead developer tobtoht[^3] addressed the community on Reddit:

> I would like to thank all the people who supported the project along the way - everyone who has filed a bug report, shared feedback, submitted a pull request, hosted a node, provided development resources, hung out on irc, sent a donation, or contributed in any other way. Sincerely, thank you!

To see what's new since Beta-9, consult the changelog[^4] page.

A GPG-signed list of the hashes[^5] can be found on the website. The signing key[^6] is in the Git repo.

Don't trust. Verify.
