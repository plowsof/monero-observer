The Haveno[^1] team has allocated $4.2K in XMR bounties[^2] to stimulate the creation of new API functions that will make possible for Haveno and its GUI to communicate with each other:

> We are starting to build Haveno's APIs and we need the help of our dev community! We set a bunch of bounties for a total of $4200, to be awarded in #Monero.[^3]

The new set of bounties includes:

```
- Add API function to receive notifications [$300]
- Add API functions to support trade chat [$400]
- Add API functions to get wallet transfers and withdraw funds [$400]
- Add API function to get market depth data of a trade pair [$250]
- Add API function to get market prices for all trade pairs [$250]
- Add API functions to manage Monero daemon connections [$1200]
- Add API functions to start and stop local Monero node [$400]
- Add API functions to initialize Haveno account [$1000]
```

For an overview of all issues (current/completed) that are eligible for an XMR reward, consult the *Bounty program*[^4] page.

Read `bounties.md`[^5] and post a comment on Github before starting any work. 

Development discusions take place on Matrix (relayed on IRC/Libera)[^6].
