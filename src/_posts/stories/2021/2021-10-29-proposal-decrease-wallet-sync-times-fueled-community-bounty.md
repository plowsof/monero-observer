The Monero community has shown strong support[^1] for Koe[^2]'s proposal[^3] to reduce scan times with 1-byte-per-output view tag by donating to Seth[^4]'s bounty[^5]:

> [..] anyone can freely donate to incentivize and fund the work required [..] -Seth

A working demo of *view tags* can be found in Koe's Seraphis PoC branch[^6] (`view_scan.h`, `mock_sp_core_utils.h`[^7]).

This change is projected to significantly decrease wallet sync times by 50-70% without sacrificing privacy:

> I think we can easily reduce scanning by around 50-70% with 1 additional byte per output, call it the 'view tagâ€™, a reduction even taking into account Janus. 

Furthermore, the increase in speed would also cover the scan time spent mitigating *Janus attacks*[^8]:

> [..] Janus might not increase scan times more than around 15-30% on average.[^9]

> [..] My recommendation is to roll this out in a hard fork alongside Janus [..] -Koe

Even with Janus accounted for and using the most conservative numbers, everyone using Monero wallets should still experience a decent speed increase. This would improve UX and potentially lead to an increase in adoption.

It is worth noting that, if implemented, this fix can **not** retroactively improve sync times. This aims to reduce wallet scan times of transactions created after the patch is implemented.

### Bounty payout criteria
