Monerujo's m2049r[^0] has announced[^1]'[^2] the *Nifty Gunthers*[^3] NFT rewards for contributors:

> To donate with Monero makes you feel super good [..] But: what if you could get something unique in return.

> We are pleased to announce that we are issuing an ERC-721 NFT collection of Gunthers to complement our project funding initiative.

All donations to projects listed on the *Monerujo Funding Site* that are worth 1 XMR or more are eligible to receive a free NFT.

Notes: 

- *Nifty Gunthers* are ERC-721 compliant and can be traded on OpenSea[^3]
- tokens will be minted on the Polygon[^4] chain so you will need a Polygon wallet address to claim yours
- previous contributors are given a *one time opportunity* to stack past donations to reach the 1 XMR threshold
 
Consult the *#nftrules*[^5] section to learn more.
