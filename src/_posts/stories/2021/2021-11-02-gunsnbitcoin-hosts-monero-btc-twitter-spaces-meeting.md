*Guns N' Bitcoin*[^1] has hosted a rather cringe *Twitter Spaces* meeting in which Monero and BTC enthusiasts have *attempted* to discuss the pros and cons of each project, DNMs, privacy, adoption, fungibility and decentralization.

Rottenwheel[^2], Douglas Tuman[^3], Justin Ehrenhofer[^4], geonic[^5] and others have joined the event to support Monero. 

Unfortunately, an obvious lack of technical knowledge displayed by Bitcoin maximalists only helped contribute to frequent awkward pauses and not to the quality of the discussion.

The session has been livestreamed and recorded[^6] by Monero Talk[^7].

This was scheduled shortly after *Guns N' Bitcoin* started accepting XMR on their website and confirmed[^8] that Seth[^9] will hold a presentation on Monero at the upcoming *Bear Arms N' Bitcoin 2022* Miami event[^10].
