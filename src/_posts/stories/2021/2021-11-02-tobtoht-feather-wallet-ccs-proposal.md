tobtoht[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2] to continue development work on *Feather Wallet*[^3] for 3 more months:

> Work 40 hours per week over the next 3 months (Nov, Dec, Jan) [..]

> As always I will rely heavily on user feedback to determine where to put my focus. Non-exhaustive list of things I want to work on / towards or experiment with:

- Prepare for next network upgrade
- Translations
- Persistent payment requests
- Recurring payments
- Reproducible macOS builds
- More transaction types (e.g. multi-destination transactions with manual input selection)
- Improved wallet_api thread safety
- Move to Qt6
- Improving UI and documentation
- Fix bugs and issues as they arise

tobtoht is the creator of *xmrguide*[^4] and maintainer of Feather Wallet. He has been an active contributor to the Monero ecosystem since April 2018.

```
Total funding needed: 93 XMR (45 EUR/h * 40 h/week * 3 months / 232 XMR/EUR).

ETA (period): 3 months (November - January 2021).
```
