XMR.Radio[^1] has confirmed the scaling down of its operation in the latest transparency report[^2] due to a lack of interest[^3]'[^4]:

> However, given the low number of listeners, I decided it wouldnâ€™t be worth the expense and time of setting one up (LLC) [..]

> In the last month, the station has received between 15-20 daily listeners and the the current balance in the coffers is $2,751.95, of which $734.53 comes from XMR/BTC donations. Thank you very much to all donors.

> All expenses are paid up until July 2022 from the original CCS fund.

If you wish to listen to the *KXMR-DB Monero Community Radio* after that date, you can donate to any of the XMR addresses listed on the *Crowdfunding*[^5] page:

```
- Music acquisition budget (2022-2023) (6.342 XMR needed)
- Rode Wireless GO II 2-Person Lavalier Microphone System/Recorder Kit (1.932 XMR needed)
- OVH US VPS annual (2022-2023) (1.015 XMR needed)
[..]
```

The station is available over clearnet[^1] and Tor[^6]. On Android and iOS this is the top XMR radio showing up in the *Live365 app*[^7]. F-droid users can open the direct station link[^8] in VLC[^9] and use it as a stream url.
