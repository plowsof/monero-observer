John Foss[^1] has announced[^2] the return of the *Monero Moon*[^3] newsletter mid December 2021:

> I just thought I'd let everyone know that as I previously mentioned In a comment on r/xmrtrader here, the Monero Moon will be returning in mid December and I will complete my CCS.

> Due to work, family, life etc I have had a busy few months and I've had to prioritise the most important things in my life (family) given how little spare time I've had. 

The last newsletter (#24) was published in August and the author has to release at least 9 more issues in order to complete all 3 CCS milestones[^4].

**Update: issue 25 was published today[^5].**
