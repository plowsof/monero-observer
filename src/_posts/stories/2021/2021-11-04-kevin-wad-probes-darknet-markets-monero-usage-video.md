Kevin Wad[^1] has *probed* several *Darknet* markets for Monero usage in his latest video[^2]:

> [..] let's actually have a look at the so-called "dark web" marketplaces and the question is: is it true that Monero is the king of the dark web?

Explored DNMs include: Monopoly, Hermes, ToRReZ, Revolution and Vice City. A more complete list can be found on Dark.fail[^3].

Kevin predicts that DNMs will eventually drop BTC and go all-in on Monero in the near future:

> [..] the trajectory of the history is to go fully Monero.

> [..] 2 or 3 years from now we will have completely 100% Monero on the darknet.
