Radiant-Grab3640[^1] is looking to spend centineros (up to 0.044 XMR) on game codes, gold, subscriptions or TF2 currency:

> Since I can't cash out small amounts of monero I am willing to overpay to buy runescape bonds/subscribtion/gold, tf2 currency or a game pass ultimate code (preferably)

> I'm open to other deals but 0.044 xmr is the most I could pay.

Read the *r/moneromarket* thread[^2] and do your own research before engaging in any trade.
