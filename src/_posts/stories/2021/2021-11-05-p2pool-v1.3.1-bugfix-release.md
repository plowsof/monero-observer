*P2Pool* version 1.3.1[^1] has been released and it fixes various bugs:

- Fixed startup logic when p2pool is started before monerod or monerod is not yet fully synchronized. It should be safe to start p2pool before monerod now.
- Fixed a crash in p2pool.exe built with msys2
- Multiple smaller fixes and performance improvements
- Slightly reduced memory usage

Before using the software, you should verify the SHA256 sums with SChernykh[^2]'s GPG key[^3].

The README[^4] has valuable information about features, defaults, how pool shares work, build instructions and a short mining guide.

If you need assistance, you can read the FAQ[^5] and reach out to other P2Pool miners on irc[^6].
