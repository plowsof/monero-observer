Unkn8wn69[^1] has accepted CryptoGrampy[^2]'s challenge[^3] to create a *MoneroShop 101* video tutorial series:

> Your goal with this bounty is to create a video tutorial that includes everything necessary for a person to build a store, accept Monero, accept payments for inventoried items (in Monero, of course), and ship those items to customers.

Minimum bounty requirements include:

- Starts with from-scratch VPS
- Uses a one-click VPS Wordpress installer (offered on many VPS providers)
- Creating a basic Wordpress store (does not need to be fancy)
- Installing SerHack's Monero WooCommerce extension

The payout criteria:

- Video covers everything discussed above
- Video is hosted on Youtube (You are welcome to host on Odysee, etc, but must be in addition to Youtube)
- All output / created works of this bounty are free to use and distribute
- Any code/commands used in the video are added to a github readme
- Have a deployed MoneroShop that users can visit and donate to

Unkn8wn69 has announced that everything should be ready within ~2 weeks:

> [..] I'll start working on the Video and the script today. I'm not completely sure about how long it will take but probably something like +/- 2 week. Everything will be uploaded on YouTube, Odysee and on the newly created repository[^4]

To further stimulate Unkn8wn69, you can contribute some XMR to the bounty address posted by the *Monero Bounties Bot*[^3]. Your donation will be reflected in the comments.


```
Current Bounty: ~0.18 XMR (Nov 5, 2021)
