DoaJC_Blogger[^1] has offered a bounty[^2] to whoever suggests the best name for a payment gateway app:

>  It's supposed to be an easy business payment gateway like Square but for Monero. It would run on a PC, tablet, or Raspberry Pi and keep track of incoming and outgoing transactions and their cost bases and have an option to synchronize them with payment terminals at other locations.

To enter, post your XMR address and the name suggestion in the Reddit thread[^2].
