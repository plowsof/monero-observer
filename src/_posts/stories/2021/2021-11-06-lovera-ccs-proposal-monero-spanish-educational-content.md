Lovera[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2] to continue producing Monero educational content in Spanish for 3 more months:

> I just created an independent YouTube Channel (LoveraXMR) where i will share Monero only content. At the same time, i will share this content (with some little modifications in the video) in my main channel (LoveraTV)[^3] to reach a greater number of users.

All Monero guides and articles can be found on the Satishilov.com[^4] blog.


```
Total funding proposed	: 13.5 XMR.

ETA (period): 3 months (December - February 2021).
```
