Monero contributor netrik182[^1] has posted a progress report[^2] for his 1 month trial[^3] CCS proposal[^4]:

> Firstly I would like to thank the community for their support and funding. Here's a brief report on what is being worked on:

- After that's merged I'll open the PR's on monero and monero-gui to reference the new instructions. (#111[^5])
- Milestone 2 is an ongoing task and I'm preparing a post on reddit soon to call for translations, as the next Monero GUI release is going soonâ„¢. 
- Subtitle translations for 'Monero Means Money' were merged into the repo[^6] [..]
- English subtitles for 'Behavioral Finance, Cryptocurrency Markets' were also merged[^7] [..]
- PR for monero-gui opened[^8] [..]

netrik182 plans to open a new proposal to continue working as a coordinator for the *Monero Localization Workgroup*[^9] as soon as this one expires (22 November 2021):

> 22nd Oct was the day I effectively stated working on this CCS so we still have time. I'd like to open a new proposal after that to continue working as coordinator of the workgroup.
