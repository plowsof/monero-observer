*moneroguides*[^1] is looking to produce a mini video series entitled *Getting to grips with Monero*:

> The mini series/playlist we propose to curate will contain 4 videos, each of varying length and on different subjects. [..] We believe this series would be a great starter pack for anyone getting into monero.

## Subjects

- Importing public keys and verifying hashes[^2]
- Setting up your own node[^3]
- Using Monero as money 
- Port forwarding and using a VPN

Previous work includes 2 videos: *Mining Monero with P2Pool - Windows* and *XMRig - Ubuntu*, which can be found on the moneroguides video channel[^4].

You can encourage this project by donating some XMR to their bounty proposal[^5].

**Update: added links to first two scripts[^2]'[^3].**
