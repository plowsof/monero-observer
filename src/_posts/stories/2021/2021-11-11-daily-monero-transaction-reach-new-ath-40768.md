Daily Monero transactions have reached a new all-time high yesterday with 40,768 confirmed, according to Moneroj.net's translog graph[^1]. 

The previous ATH of 40,194 was recorded on the 23rd of July 2021.

The number of confirmed transactions on the network has more than doubled in the past year.

This is part of a long-term upward trend that can be traced back to 2016.
