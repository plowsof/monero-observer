gingeropolous[^1] has proposed a bounty[^2] for adding I2P[^3] support to the official Monero GUI[^4] wallet:

> There should be an option in the monero GUI to launch an i2p service that monero can then interface with for its communications. It will all be done with checkboxes and button clicks - no entering command lines into settings.

It is worth noting that users can already use I2P with the CLI[^5].

The payout criteria:

> payout will be when a user can download the GUI from getmonero.org, click a button from within the GUI to make i2p work, and then have monerod interface with i2p automagically.

To start working on the project yourself, you should make your intentions public by posting a comment in the bounty's thread[^2].

Alternatively you can contribute some XMR to the bounty address posted by the *Monero Bounties Bot*. Your donation will be reflected in the comments.

```
Total Bounty (so far): ~0.8 XMR (Nov 11, 2021)
```
