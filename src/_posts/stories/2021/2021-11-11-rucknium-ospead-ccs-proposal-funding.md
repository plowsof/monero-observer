Rucknium[^1]'s *OSPEAD* CCS proposal[^2] has just been moved to the next stage and is finally ready for community funding.

As previously reported[^3]'[^4], the proposal is an attempt to fortify Monero against statistical attacks and it has been thoroughly reviewed by the community for the past month.

## Milestones & Funding

```
Total funding required: 171 XMR (67/74/30 XMR).
ETA: 11.5 weeks
```

According to Rucknium:

> I estimate that development and implementation of OSPEAD will take 11.5 weeks of full time equivalent (FTE) labor, i.e. 460 hours. 

- Milestone 1: Deliver fully specified estimation plan to the scientific review panel (4.5 weeks FTE)
- Milestone 2: Deliver initial probability density function to the scientific review panel (5 weeks FTE)
- Milestone 3: Deliver final version of probability density function to Monero developers (2 weeks FTE)

> The 11.5 FTE weeks of work will not be completely contiguous, but I expect Milestone 3 to be reached by February or March 2022.

To support the proposal you can donate XMR to the address listed on the *Funding Required* page[^5].

**Update: fully funded[^6].**
