ChangeNow[^1]'s Editor-in-chief Yennie Geller[^2] sees Monero at $1,500 by 2025[^3]:

> We do expect the price of XMR to continue its upward trend though, and while we do not share the ebullience of those who see it jumping up to $5,000, we cautiously expect it to be around $1,500.

However, the prediction for the end of this year is a rather conservative one: XMR **below** the $305 resistance. Furthermore, $365 is Yennie's XMR top for March 2022.
