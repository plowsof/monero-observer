Douglas Tuman[^1] is looking to clear the air[^2] around the upcoming Monerotopia 2022 Miami event[^3] by relaunching as *XMRtopia Uncensored*:

> Join us TMRW for a LIVE chat @ 11AM-EST to discuss the recent #Monerotopia2022 debacle & get ur thoughts on relaunching as XMRtopia Uncensored! 

According to Douglas[^4], he effectively had to *cancel* one of the listed speakers (Chris Sky[^5]) after controversy:

> I was going to let the community vote but some powerful figures in the community are threatening to effectively cancel the entire event if the outcome is in Chris's favor. Not even MoneroTopia is safe from cancel culture.

Even though multiple[^6] shots[^7] have been fired[^8] from all[^9] sides[^10], it seems that the Monero community is ready to leave this incident behind and focus on more important things.

Consult my previous report for the updated list of speakers[^11].

*Early Adopter* tickets[^12] can be bought right now for $59 USD from the new Monerotopia website.

Hopefully Douglas can set this whole thing straight in tomorrow's Monerotopia episode, which should be streamed at 11AM (EST)[^13].
