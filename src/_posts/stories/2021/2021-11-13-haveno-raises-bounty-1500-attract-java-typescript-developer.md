The Haveno[^1] team has raised the bounty[^2] associated with issue #136[^3] from $1K to $1,500 in an  effort to attract a capable Java/Typescript developer:

> We have one very important issue that needs to be solved as soon as possible. It's fundamental to get Haveno's user interface ready.[^4]

As reported[^5] last month, this is part of the initial $4.2K budget that was allocated to stimulate the creation of new API functions that will make possible for Haveno and its GUI to communicate with each other.
