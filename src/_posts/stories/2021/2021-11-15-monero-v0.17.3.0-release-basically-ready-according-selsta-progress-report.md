Monero v0.17.3.0 release is *basically ready*, according to selsta[^1]'s November 2021 CCS progress report[^2]:

> v0.17.3.0 is basically ready, once Ledger puts out an update it can be released.

Apparently the release is only being delayed by Ledger at this point[^3]. 

Although selsta has submitted the PR[^4] to update the version number weeks ago, Ledger devs have yet to merge it.

### selsta's dev updates

- Worked on making Monero and Monero GUI compile on ARM Mac, this is the first step for upcoming release binaries.
- Spent some time on debugging https://github.com/monero-project/monero-gui/issues/3594, unfortunately the GUI deadlocks inside Windows code, so it's basically guesswork by updating various dependencies.
- Updated the codebase to C++14.

A more complete list of changes can be found on Github[^5]'[^6].
