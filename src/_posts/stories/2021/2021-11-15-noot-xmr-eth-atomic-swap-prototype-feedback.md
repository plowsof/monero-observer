noot[^1] is looking for community feedback[^2] on `atomic-swap`[^3], an XMR-ETH atomic swap prototype:

> I really want this to reach a point where it's usable and user-friendly, so any feedback on the user side of things (or anything at all really) is very much appreciated. (I also don't have any experience with web dev so if you can build a UI for it I would love that)

The protocol is described in the README[^4]:

> [..] it's relatively simple, most of the heavy lifting occurs in an ethereum smart contract. 

> my next steps are to build a terminal UI of sorts so that it's easier to interact with, and eventually a real in-browser UI.

Crypt0-Bear[^5] is also looking to create a similar tool. He started to conduct some research[^6] in August for a cross chain trust-less Monero-Ethereum atomic swaps PoC.
