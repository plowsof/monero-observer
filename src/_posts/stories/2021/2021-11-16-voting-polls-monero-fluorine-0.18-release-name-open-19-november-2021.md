Voting polls[^1] for the upcoming Monero v0.18 *Fluorine* release name are open until November 19th:

> Only the single favorite choice will win the poll.

> Give each of the following choices a rank, where a smaller-numbered rank means that you prefer that choice more.

The options were suggested[^2] by the community, based on Monero's release naming convention[^3]:

- Fluorine Fermi (current favorite)
- Fluorine Firewheel 
- Fluorine Fornax
- Fluorine Flare 	
- Fluorine Flamingo  
- Fluorine Firmament

Contact the poll supervisor (Justin Ehrenhofer[^4]) if you need help.

You can vote until Friday (2021-11-19).
