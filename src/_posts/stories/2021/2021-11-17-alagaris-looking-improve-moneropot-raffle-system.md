Alagaris[^1] is looking for feedback[^2] to improve his *MoneroPot*[^3] raffle system:

> I'm going to seed it around $1k of winnings hopefully it becomes more every day than less without adding more XMR. Let me know if you guys have any suggestions, ideas or concerns.

It is worth noting that at this point, there is a trust issue with this project:

- code not open source[^4] 
- no public view key published[^4]
- no deterministic proof model[^5]	

As always, do your own research before investing in any new project.

**Update 21/11/19: Alagaris has improved the project's trust model and needs more feedback[^6].**

**Update 22/1/31: website is DOWN![^7].**

**Update 22/2/4: website moved to a different server and domain name[^8].**
