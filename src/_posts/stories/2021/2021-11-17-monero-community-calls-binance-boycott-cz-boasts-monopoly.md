The Monero community is calling for a Binance boycott[^1] as CEO Changpeng Zhao[^2] boasts about his monopoly in *Associated Press* interview[^3]:

> [Binance welcomes regulations] for many reasons. One of those minor reasons is a selfish reason: that in a regulated industry, the few larger players will remain. The smaller players do get cut off, which is unfortunate for those guys.

The platform's long-standing issues[^4]'[^5] with XMR withdrawals isn't helping either. Several theories[^6]'[^7] that speculate on Binance's Monero liquidity problems have been formulated.

Everything seems to point to shady practices that can only be countered by withdrawing all XMR from Binance and other CEXs and making use of alternative platforms[^8].
