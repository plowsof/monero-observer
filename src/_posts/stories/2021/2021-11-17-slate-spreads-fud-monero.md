Slate[^1] magazine is spreading *FUD* about Monero and its community with Jake Dean[^2]'s latest article:

> *The Bitcoin Competitor Beloved by the Alt-Right and Criminals*[^3]

The freelance *journalist* does his best to paint Monero as a coin that's exclusively used by extremists, criminals and racists.

His skillful use of sensitive keywords, crafted to trigger people, seems to align perfectly with Slate's slogan: *Sticky, Provocative, Generative*. 

Perhaphs this is how the *Graham Holdings Company[^4]*-owned site has earned the *National Magazine Award for General Excellence Online* .. a decade ago, in 2011[^5].

There's no doubt that FUD sells, but it doesn't even come close to any reasonable definition of journalism that I could find.

It is worth mentioning that Jake's previous *reporting* for Slate includes articles about Lady Gaga & Justin Bieber[^6], rainbow lights at a soccer tournament[^7] and VTubers[^8].

A rather big grain of salt comes to mind. As long as this type of stuff doesn't divide us as a community, Monero will survive.

Not shifting the focus from research and development looks like a solid plan: 

> Unfortunately, the task of tracing will be made harder by the recent announcement of atomic swaps between Monero and Bitcoin [..]

Fortunately, all of this can be interpreted as free advertising.
