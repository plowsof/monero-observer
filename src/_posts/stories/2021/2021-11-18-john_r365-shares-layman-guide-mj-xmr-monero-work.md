john_r365[^1] has shared *A Layman’s Guide*[^2] to mj-xmr[^3]'s work on Monero:

> As a passionate outside observer, I like to try and understand what the different developers do. However, despite MJ writing very thorough work reports, I struggled to grasp what his work is about.

> This is a post for anyone who's keeping tabs on the project, and like me, didn't understand the work that mj-xmr does on the project.

The article is the result of a recent telephone call between the two. 

mj-xmr thanked John for his work in *-community*[^4] and made himself available for community questions on Reddit[^5]:

> Many thanks to john_r365 for his time and patience! An article, that explains in layman's terms the somewhat cryptic monthly reports, that I publish.

> [..] it's quite expected, that questions may arise. I'm happy to answer them.

**Update: added mj-xmr quote.**
