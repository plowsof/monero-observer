Kraken[^0] looks set to drop Monero support for UK customers, as users report[^1]'[^2]'[^3]'[^4]'[^5] on emails received today from the company:

> We are reaching out regarding an update to trading and funding of Monero (XMR) on Kraken. 

> In compliance with UK regulations, Kraken (Payward Ltd) will no longer be supporting Monero (XMR) on its platform. 

Here are the relevant dates:

### 23 November 2021

- Monero margin positions will be set to reduce only

### 26 November 2021

- all Monero (XMR) trading on Kraken will cease in the UK (includes Instand buy/sell services, XMR/BTC, XMR/USD & XMR/EUR order book trading)
- XMR deposits will no longer be credited after this date
- all open margin positions will be force liquidated and any open orders will be cancelled

Kraken has launched Monero trading on their platform in 2017[^6]. 

Although this move doesn't seem correlated with any new piece of regulation, it is most probably only a matter of time until Kraken will completely delist XMR everywhere. 

All CEXs will eventually have to comply with AML standards imposed by regulators such as UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)[^7].

There are alternatives[^8] and this is the best time to make the transition: atomic swaps[^9], Localmonero[^10], CakeWallet[^11], Bisq[^12] and soon Haveno[^13].
