moneroguides[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2] to produce a *Getting to grips with Monero* mini video series:

> The mini series/playlist we propose to curate will contain 4 videos, each of varying length and on different subjects. They are: Importing public keys and verifying hashes, Setting up your own node, Using Monero as money and Using Monero with enhanced privacy.

> After some careful consideration we've decided to put together a proposal for the CCS.
We now believe that this is probably the best method for garnering both community support and input.

moneroguides has also proposed a bounty[^3] for the same project earlier this month, and the requested CCS funding was adjusted to take that into account:

> The amount we're asking for is reflected by a rate of $25/h less ~1XMR for what we have already raised through our bounties proposal.

Anyone can still attempt to claim that bounty at this point.


```
Total funding proposed: 12 XMR.

ETA (period): 6 weeks.
```
