Rucknium[^1] has published a list with *Open Research Questions*[^2] that are relevant to Monero:

> This is an effort to construct a list of open research question relevant to Monero, as discussed in a recent MRL meeting[^3].

This effort was inspired by Grin[^4]'s *Open Research Problems*[^5] list and it aims to help prioritize MRL[^6] efforts, inform external researchers of key Monero questions and to potentially serve as a basis for *Request For Proposal*-style grantmaking in the future.

Rucknium encourages the community to get involved in the process:

> This list is a work in progress. Please give feedback below, including additional questions that should be added.
