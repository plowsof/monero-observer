The Monero community is clearly interested in Elizabeth[^1]'s XMR-ETH atomic swap prototype[^2], as the associated bounty[^3] has jumped to over 8 XMR in the first 24 hours.

She has recently thanked the community for all the support in a Reddit thread[^4]:

> I knew the project would be useful but I didn't realize how popular it would be! it's really motivated me to keep building it out and getting it usable asap. really glad to be contributing to the monero ecosystem <3

As previously reported[^5], you can find more about the protocol on its Github repo[^6].
