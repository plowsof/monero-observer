CryptoGrampy[^1] has proposed a bounty[^2] for the creation of a video tutorial that helps users set up BTCPayServer[^3] for Monero only on a VPS/home server:

> The goal of this bounty is to create a video tutorial on getting BTCPayServer set up for Monero, and Monero only, on either a home server or a VPS [..]

The tutorial must use the BTCPayServer docker/manual setup, a pruned Monero node, exclude BTC and demonstrate a successful Monero payment.

Check the *Minimum requirements*[^2] section for more information.

To start working on the project yourself, you should make your intentions public by posting a comment in the bounty's thread[^2].

Alternatively you can contribute some XMR to the bounty address posted by the *Monero Bounties Bot*. Your donation will be reflected in the comments.


```
Total Bounty: TBD
```
