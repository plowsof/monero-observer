Sethforprivacy[^1] has shared his self-hosted privacy-preserving services repository[^2]:

> This repository contains everything you need to start self-hosting a core set of privacy-preserving services that I have found helpful, all run via a common Docker Compose configuration using Let's Encrypt for SSL certificates.

Users can test all of the services that Seth is currently self-hosting, including Invidious[^3], Nitter[^4], Teddit[^5] and a Monero Blockchain Explorer[^6]:

> As a reminder, I have *many* tools hosted and available for use

A complete list is available on his website[^7].
