ichbinnichtschwul64[^1] has opened his PrivateMonero.org[^2] remote onion node to the public:

> I have finally taken the time to setup my own Monero node for anyone needing a secure remote node. It can be accessed through mainnet and Tor hostnames. I only use fast and reliable servers, this one is located in the eastern United States.

The addresses are:

- node.privatemonero.org:18081 (clearnet)
- 76ofgm47g4abrm6jpjzefvm4usa4pjhhue7yttejzknvkaysxagwonqd.onion:18081 (tor)

A forum[^3] section should be available soon on the same website.
