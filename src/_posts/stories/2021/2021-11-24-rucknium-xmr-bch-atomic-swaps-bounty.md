Rucknium[^1] has proposed a bounty[^2] for the creation of a XMR-BCH atomic swaps implementation:

> Recently BTC<>XMR atomic swaps have become available on mainnet. Let's do the same for BCH!

```
Total Bounty: 1.20471 XMR & 0.468 BCH (to date)
```

### Minimum requirements

- open source
- demo on mainnets

The BCH donation address[^3] for this bounty is being administered by Rucknium:

> I have established a BCH address for donations for this bounty. I will personally custody the funds and release them to whoever completes the bounty requirements.

To start working on the project yourself, you should make your intentions public by posting a comment in the bounty's thread[^2].

Alternatively you can contribute some XMR to the bounty address posted by the *Monero Bounties Bot* and/or to the BCH address posted by Rucknium in the comments section.

**Update: updated bounty.**
