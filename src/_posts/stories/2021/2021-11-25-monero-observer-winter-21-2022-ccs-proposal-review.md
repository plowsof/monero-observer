The Monero Observer CCS proposal[^1] for Winter 21/2022 is ready for community review:

> I will continue to maintain Monero Observer (https://monero.observer) for the next 3 months (winter 21/2022): December, January and February.

The past 100+ days were an amazing and humbling journey for me. Although exhaustion did get the best of me at times, I am happy that I have not missed a single day of reporting, researching and thinking about the project. I want to keep going.

As long as I am healthy, I will do my best to keep Monero Observer alive for you.

Thanks for all the support!
