Particl[^1]'s upcoming *BasicSwap* private DEX will be *fully compatible with Monero from the get-go*, according to their latest announcement[^2]:

> No KYC, no trickery, no false promises. Just pure decentralization and privacy. And yes, in case you were wondering, it is fully compatible with Monero (XMR) and will be right from the get-go!

Besides Monero, the exchange will also support Bitcoin, Litecoin, Namecoin and Particl. 

Features include:

- True Monero support
- No account, sign up, or KYC
- Incredibly low and competitive fees
- User-friendly interface
- No third-party, intermediary, or middleman at any point
- Taproot compatible
- Lightning Network compatible (in later versions)

The Open Beta release should be ready *soon* after some minor bugs are fixed, the temporary UI is finished and the build and install tests are completed.
