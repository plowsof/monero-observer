Builderra[^1], a beginner friendly web builder, has recently started accepting Monero and is now considering removing all other payment options[^2]:

> Last week we decided to accept Monero on our software, and maybe in the future, we will only accept Monero.

The all-in-one platform features a drag and drop page builder, online stores, landing pages and sales funnels.

According to webbuilder247[^3], clients that use their e-commerce option will soon be able to accept Monero as well.
