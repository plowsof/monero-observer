rbrunner7[^0] has published another thought-provoking Monero science fiction short story, titled *Nightmare*[^1]. This is number #15 of the series[^2].

Instead of spoilers, I will just share a quote from the author:

> The aim of my story was to entertain, to tell some interesting things from Monero's history, and to show that even such attractive things like alternative daemon implementations might bring some dangers with them, and that's why it's a good idea to stay vigilant.

If you find this insightful, you can support rbrunner7 by making a donation to his XMR address[^3].

Also read *Proof of Distance*[^4] and check out other titles from the same series[^2].
