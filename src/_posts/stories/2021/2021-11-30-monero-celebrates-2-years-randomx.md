Monero is celebrating 2 years of *RandomX*[^0] today. On 30 November 2019 the *legendary* network upgrade that replaced *CryptoNight*[^1] with the new PoW algorithm was completed with the release of Monero 0.15.0.0 *Carbon Chamaeleon*[^2]:

> The scheduled network upgrade introduces a few major changes. First and foremost, a new long-term Proof-of-Work algorithm, namely RandomX, will be introduced.[^3]

You can find out more about the story of RandomX on the *Monero Outreach*[^4] website and by reading *Gingeropolous*[^5]'s article[^6].

rottenwheel[^7] took the time to wish the Monero community a *happy birthday*:

> Happy birthday, RandomX! Happy birthday, Monero! Happy birthday, XMR enthusiasts![^8]

May RandomX continue to render *ASICs* useless forevermore.
