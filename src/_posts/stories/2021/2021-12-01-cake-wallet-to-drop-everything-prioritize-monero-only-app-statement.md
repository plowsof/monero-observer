Cake Wallet[^1] has decided to *drop everything and prioritize the Monero only app*, according to a public statement[^2] released in less than 24 hours after community backlash[^3] over the Zcash support announcement:

> The recent announcement of adding Zcash to Cake Wallet has brought out very passionate voices against this move and some supporting it. 

> [the plan for Cake Technologies:] Drop everything and prioritize the Monero only app. BTW, we have ALWAYS wanted to do a Monero only app for the hardcore folks.

> For zcash, we will build a new and separate app.

The Monero-only wallet should be ready by the end of the year. Meanwhile, the Monero community is considering forking[^4] Cake's codebase.
