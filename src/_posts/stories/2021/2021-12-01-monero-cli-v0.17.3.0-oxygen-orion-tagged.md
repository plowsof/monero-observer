The official Monero CLI v0.17.3.0 *Oxygen Orion*[^1] has been tagged and the release binaries should be out soon. The GUI[^2] version will shortly be tagged as well.

> Aside from many small bug fixes, most notable may be p2pool support. On the developer side, lots of cleanup in the build system.

*dEBRUYNE_1*[^3] has encouraged contributors to post the results of their deterministic build processes[^4] on Reddit[^5] and submit the hashes via *pull request*:

> If at all possible, please also sign and submit the hashes as a PR per the instructions above, as that is the most useful validation of the deterministic builds.
