pluja[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2] to build the *Moneroj.info*[^3] project:

> I aim to build an up-to-date knowledge base available in, at least, 3 different languages with quality translations. It will be newbie-friendly so anyone can understand what is being explained. Also there will be some more detailed articles for more experienced users.

The CCS would fund his work on this knowledge base while also covering the maintenance costs for *kycnot.me*[^4] and *iseeyour.cash*[^5]'[^6].

```
Total funding proposed: 22 XMR.

ETA (period): ~6 months (December-April 2022).
```

### Milestones

- M1: First moneroj.info version (6 XMR)
- M2: Second moneroj.info version (6 XMR)
- M3: Third moneroj.info version (6 XMR)
- M4: Other projects - maintenance for 6 months (4 XMR)
