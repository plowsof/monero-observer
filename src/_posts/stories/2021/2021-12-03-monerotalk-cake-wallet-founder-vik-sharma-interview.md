In this Monero Talk episode[^1]'[^2], Douglas Tuman interviews Vik Sharma[^3], the founder of Cake Wallet[^4].

Vik addressed the Monero community after the recent Zcash controversy[^5]'[^6]:

> [..] nobody has ever done shielded-transaction only wallet [..] we can do something that nobody else is doing, so that was the thought behind it [..]

> [..] by putting Zcash in Cake Wallet I don't think we're gonna be fooling the Monero community into thinking one is better than the other, or one is equal [..] what I anticipated is the Monero community to say "Okay, fine whatever, but we're gonna continue using our Monero part of the wallet." That's how I thought the response would be [..]"

> [..] to get this Monero-only app out first is a pritority right now [..]

If their compromise plan works out as expected, Cake will have 3 separate wallets:

- Monero-only app
- Cake Original (multiple assets)
- Zcash-only wallet

Vik also confirmed that Cake Wallet will join Coincards[^7] as an official sponsor of the 2022 Monerotopia Miami event[^8]'[^9].
