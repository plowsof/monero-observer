Michael Schloh von Bennewitz[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2]'[^3] to serve Monero content at *The North American Bitcoin Conference* (TNABC Miami 2022)[^4]:

> This CCS proposal absorbs most of the costs of serving Monero content to four thousand visitors at The North American Bitcoin Conference.

```
Total funding proposed: 66 XMR.

ETA (period): January 17-19, 2022.
```

Also part of the proposal is the distribution of Monero wallets free of charge:

> Our giveaway wallets implement cold storage technology without the use of electronic circuits. Nobody has ever succeeded manufacturing wallets with Tyvek 1082D sheet material, so worldwide this will be the first wallet of its kind.
