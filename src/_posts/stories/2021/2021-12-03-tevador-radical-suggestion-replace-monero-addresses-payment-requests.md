tevador[^1] has put forth a radical suggestion[^2] to replace Monero addresses with payment requests in UkoeHB[^3]'s *Seraphis Address Schemes* Github issue[^4]:

> There is no doubt that Seraphis will bring quite large user-facing changes regardless of which exact addressing scheme is used. It may be worthwhile to take this opportunity to rethink the paradigm and move away from addresses completely.

Although there is little doubt that this change would improve end-user experience, there are, however, some concerns over the implications of introducing DNS reliance, voiced by LocalMonero[^5]:

> [..] if most services switch to DNS-tied payment requests then that would open up a significant vector of attack. Understand the long-term implications of your proposal, especially in the context of aggressive resistance from (evil) state actors to Monero's global adoption.[^6]

You can join the discussion in *MRL* issue#92[^7] to share your thoughts on this idea.

**Update: updated JAMTIS available[^8] (still WiP).**
