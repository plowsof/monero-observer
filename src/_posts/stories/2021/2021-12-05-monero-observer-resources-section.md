A Monero Observer **Resources**[^1] section is now available on the website.

My intention was for the page to (eventually) serve as a depository of up-to-date links to useful projects and contacts in the Monero community.

Please note that this is a *WiP*. Edits and suggestions can be sent to me, preferrably via XMPP.

Let me know if you find this useful.
