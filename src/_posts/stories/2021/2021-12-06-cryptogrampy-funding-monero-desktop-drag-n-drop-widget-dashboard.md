CryptoGrampy[^1] is seeking funding for his Monero Desktop Drag and Drop Widget Dashboard[^2] idea:

> [..] I thought of a potentially very cool idea... rather than creating a one off desktop app, why not build out a desktop drag n' drop widget dashboard [..]

The software would allow users to create their own custom dashboards and developers to create and publish *awesome Monero experiences without having to constantly re-invent the wheel*.

### Bounty Requirements

- create the proof of concept in Electron using a popular front end framework and drag and drop library
- create a drag and drop Monerod controller widget that can connect to Monerod
- create a drag and drop timer widget that can specify monerod start and stop times
- create a data display widget that displays current monerod data
- the dashboard is persistent and will retain the widgets upon restart
- code is all open source
[..]


To support CryptoGrampy's work, you can contribute some XMR to the bounty address posted by the *Monero Bounties Bot*[^2]. Your donation will be reflected in the comments.


```
Total Bounty: ~0.8 XMR (so far)
```

There's also a related discussion thread[^3] available.
