gnuteardrops[^1] has shared a new art project with the community: the *Monero.Graphics*[^2] repository:

> I design Monero graphics that can be used by everyone. Share them with your friends and letâ€™s spread the Monero love!

The artist has licensed all graphics *CC BY-SA 4.0*[^3] and that means anyone can copy, redistribute, remix and transform all of them for any purpose, even commercially.

You can send your feedback to gnuteardrops via email[^4] or matrix[^5] and donate some XMR[^1] to stimulate their continued work in our community.
