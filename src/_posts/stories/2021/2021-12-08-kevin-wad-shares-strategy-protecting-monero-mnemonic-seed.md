Kevin Wad[^1] has published a new video[^2] in which he shares his strategy of protecting Monero mnemonic seeds from *hacks and break-ins*:

> In this video we have a look at how to protect yourself from hackers and thefts. This is my ultimate strategy to become unhackable.

> [..] I'm sharing my vision and you have to make your own research and then establish your own point of view and if you think that this is the best technique, then you can implement [it].

> I think the best way to secure Monero right now is to use Virgin Mnemonic Seed with the passphrase [..]
