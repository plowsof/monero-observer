midipoet[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2] to fund *MoneroKon 2022*[^3] that should take place in Lisbon, Portugal:

> The Monero conference will be in a similar theme to the last MoneroKon, which was hosted in Denver, Colorado in 2019.

> We are hoping to put on a professional two-day event, with capacity for 200 people, live-streamed (hopefully), and including an afterparty.

According to midipoet, a *core group* of contributors from *#monero-events*[^4] will be overseeing the project: *msvb, ajs, carrington, kico, reset* and others.

```
Total funding proposed: 320 XMR (CCS#1).

ETA: summer/TBD (targetting June 2022).
```

The proposal doesn't have any milestones. Instead, midipoet has suggested the possibility of a second CCS proposal to cover all costs:

> We are hoping this will be the first of two CCS requests. This first one covers the total (maximum) estimated cost of putting on the event - €55,0000 (320 XMR @ current price of €175 per XMR)

> Please note that if the actual event costs are not significantly lower than the quoted maximum then a second CCS will be required to cover costs for speaker and volunteer travel and accommodation. 

This has attracted some criticism[^5] from some members of the community, including rottenwheel[^6] and sgp[^7].

**Update: midipoet has updated the proposal after prolonged community discussions[^8].**

**Update 22/1/10: moved to funding[^9].**

**Update: 22/2/13: fully funded[^10].**
