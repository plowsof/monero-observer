noot[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2]'[^3] to continue developing the XMR-ETH atomic swaps prototype[^4]:

> This proposal is for the continued development of ETH-XMR atomic swaps. The milestones include continued maintence and testing of the current codebase, gas improvements, network and integration testing, and documentation.

This proposal comes after she has successfully executed the first ever mainnet XMR-ETH atomic swap on Arbitrum, as previously reported[^5].

### Milestones

1. Maintenance of existing codebase (estimated 2 weeks)
2. Swap contract improvements (estimated 2 weeks)
3. DLEq integration (estimated 2-4 weeks)
4. Integration testing (estimated 2 weeks)
5. Network testing and infrastructure (estimated 3 weeks)
6. Additional research and pre-print paper (2-4 weeks)
7. UI (unspecified)

```
Total funding proposed: 56 XMR.

ETA: ~21 weeks.
```

The pre-production software release will include binaries for Linux, Windows and MacOS.
