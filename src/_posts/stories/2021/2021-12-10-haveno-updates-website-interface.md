Haveno[^1] has updated[^2] the website interface and added new Blog[^3] and FAQ[^4] pages:

> We updated our website: haveno.exchange Now there is a blog, which will be used to update the community, and a FAQ with common questions and a detailed comparison with #Bisq!

The website can be easily accessed via Tor, as it contains no Javascript. 

The Haveno non-custodial Monero DEX should be production-ready by the end of 2022. The frontend of the Haveno app will be in ReactJS.
