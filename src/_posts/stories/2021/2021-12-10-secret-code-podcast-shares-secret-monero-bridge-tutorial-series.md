Secret Code Podcast[^1] has shared a 4-part tutorial series on the *Secret Monero Bridge*[^2].

### Videos

- Part 1: Deposit XMR to the Bridge and convert to sXMR[^3]
- Part 2: Use sXMR to trade & liquidity provide on SecretSwap[^4]
- Part 3: Removing liquidity and selling to sXMR on SecretSwap[^5]
- Part 4: Withdraw sXMR using the Bridge and convert to XMR[^6]

To perform the actions described in this series, users need to have a Keplr[^7] wallet, SCRT[^8] for gas, a Monero wallet and an email address.

The process is still controversial, as it requires the use of an email address and potentially a Discord account to open support tickets, as previously reported[^9].

You can find more information about the Secret Monero Bridge on the Secret Network blog[^10].
