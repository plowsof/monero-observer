I would like to thank you all for the continued support: 

25 contributors have donated 21 XMR in a week to fully fund the project's maintenance for another 3 months (December 2021, January & February 2022)[^1].

Special mentions:

- everyone that keeps tipping me to the XMR address listed on the [/about](/about) page
- the good human that donated a big amount to this CCS proposal

I will do my best to continue maintaining and improving the project. Thanks for being a Monero Observer reader and supporter!
