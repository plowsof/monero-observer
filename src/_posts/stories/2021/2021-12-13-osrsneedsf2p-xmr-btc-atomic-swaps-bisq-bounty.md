OsrsNeedsF2P[^1] has proposed a bounty[^2] for the addition of a XMR-BTC atomic swaps trading pair to Bisq[^3] DEX:

> This proposal is to add BTC <-> XMR swaps to Bisq. This follows recent developments regarding the first BTC <-> XMR atomic swap implementation and the 1.8.0 Bisq release featuring the first atomic swaps on the exchange.

```
Total Bounty: 0.27 XMR (to date)
```

### Payout criteria

- BTC/XMR as an atomic swap is tradeable on a released, official version of Bisq
- Payout is to the developer who implements the atomic swap trading pair, not the developer who packages the release
- For multiple developers, give it to the lead developer and let them distribute it to any peers

With a Haveno[^4] release still ~1 year away, this would give users more choices and prevent *monopolistic innovation stifling*, according to the proposer.

To start working on the project yourself, you should make your intentions public by posting a comment in the bounty's thread[^2] and in Bisq's proposal repository[^5].

To increase the bounty you can contribute some XMR to the bounty address posted by the *Monero Bounties Bot*[^2].
