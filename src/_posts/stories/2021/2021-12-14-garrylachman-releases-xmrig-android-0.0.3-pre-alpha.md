garrylachman[^1] has released the Pre-Alpha 0.0.3[^2] for his Android GUI miner *xmrig-for-android*[^3]:

> I decided to fork my baby (React Native XMRig), refactor most of the code & features and forward it to the community.

The dev is currently looking for some community feedback[^4] on the very early alpha software.

To read more about the project, consult the associated bounty[^5].
