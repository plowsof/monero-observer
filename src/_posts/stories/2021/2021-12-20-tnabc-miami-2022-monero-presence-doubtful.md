msvblab[^1]'s recent CCS proposal[^2] has attracted a lot of attention, some support but also a considerable amount of skepticism. 

While there were solid arguments made by both sides, the proposal's expiry date (30 December 2021) and the conference date (mid-January 2022) have prompted Monero core team's luigi1111[^3] to step in and set a deadline for a decision to be made by Wednesday (22 December):

> Unfortunately we don't have a large luxury of time to make a decision, based on the dates of the conferences (and related, the self-imposed expiration of this CCS). I'd like to see this merged or rejected by Wednesday the 22nd.

> Presently, given the weight of positive and negative feedback, and a strong anti-gatekeeper mentality, I lean towards merging.[^4]

Here is why some community members are against this proposal:

- public Monero image perception concerns (voiced by rottenwheel[^5] and others)
- Kastelo project connection controversy (msvblab's FFS is uncompleted to date)[^6]'[^7]
- potential conflicts of interest (Cake Wallet)
- high costs/wasting money (accomodations, Tyvek wallets, etc)
- no real value for Monero (voiced by fluffypony[^8])

Other community members including ArticMine and binaryFate are supportive of the proposal:

> I fully support this proposal and in my view should be merged for funding. - ArticMine[^9]

> There is no "one" community that could agree on everything, nor is there a fixed pot of money to assign to proposals - the CCS is not zero-sum. For this reason alone, I'd like to see this proposal merged and everyone free to support it if they want. -binaryFate[^10] 

It is doubtful at this point that Monero will be represented at *The North American Bitcoin Conference* (TNABC Miami 2022)[^11] in this format.

To learn more about this proposal, ask questions and share your opinion, consult !274[^2] and my previous report[^12].

**Update: expiration date was extended by the proposer to January 5th 2022[^13].**

**Update 12/23: proposal was closed (not merged)[^14].**
