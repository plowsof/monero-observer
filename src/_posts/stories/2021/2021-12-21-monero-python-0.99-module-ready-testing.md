The updated `monero-python`[^1] module is ready for testing, as v0.99[^2] has been recently tagged by Monero Ecosystem[^3] contributor emesik[^4]:

> I'm happy to announce that I've just released the version 0.99 of monero-python, which is a comprehensive Python library for handling Monero [..][^5]

This dev initiative was funded via Monero's old FFS (Forum Funding System)[^6] in 2017.

The tool is compatible with Python 2.x, 3.x and works with Monero 0.13.x. The latest version is also *10Ã— faster than it used to be*, according to its maintainer.

Testers are encouraged to report any issues so v1.00 can be released without any major bugs.

Documentation is available on Readthedocs[^7]. 

To support the development of the `monero-python` open source library, you can donate some XMR to the address listed in the README[^8].
