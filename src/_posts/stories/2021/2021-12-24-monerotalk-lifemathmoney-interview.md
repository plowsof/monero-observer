In this Monero Talk episode[^1]'[^2], Douglas Tuman interviews Indian crypto enthusiast Harsh Strongman (LifeMathMoney)[^3] on Bitcoin vs Monero:

> [..] to have proper, untraceable, unconfiscable currency is a big thing and it has to be private.. (14:05)

The two discuss politics, government, privacy, fungibility and the guest's highly engaged tweet[^4] from last week:

> Tell me how Bitcoin is better than Monero. Explain with logic.

Apparently, Harsh Strongman is planning to incorporate Monero into his free crypto currency online courses[^5].

**Update: added Monero to the privacy section of the crypto course[^6].**
