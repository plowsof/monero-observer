UkoeHB[^1]'s *What is Seraphis, and Why Should You Care?*[^2] post was recently merged[^3] by binaryFate[^4] and is now live on the official Getmonero.org blog:

> As an 'abstraction', Seraphis defines rules about how you can design a real (privacy-focused) transaction protocol without specifying concrete algorithms.

The post touches on the pros and cons of Triptych and Seraphis and also briefly mentions Lelantus-Spark.

The article has been approved after being reviewed by several Monero contributors over the past few months, including: erciccione[^5], SamsungGalaxyPlayer[^6] and selsta[^7].
