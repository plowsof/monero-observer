description: Plans for Monero Observer in 2022, a roadmap.

Not much is going on in the community today, as most people are celebrating Christmas, so it might be a good time to share my Monero Observer 2022 plans.

This is not exactly a roadmap, but more like a set of very rough ideas to point in a general direction.

### Roadmap

- fresh outreach plan (connect with related privacy communities like Tor, Tails, Whonix, Qubes)
- Monero Observer Community (chat server/forum)
- Monero and privacy/security tutorials for beginners (text, maybe video)
- selfhost useful services for the community
- actively support others who want to start contributing to the ecosystem (selfhost, maintain, code, create side projects, publish stuff, apply for funding)

Not sure how many of the items above I will be able to accomplish next year, so no promises. 

I want to help Monero as much as I can, inspire and educate more people and empower new contributors. All that without sacrificing the cypherpunk ways. 

Message me on XMPP[^1] if you want to get involved with the project in 2022. I need your help.

Thanks for reading. Relax and enjoy family time!
