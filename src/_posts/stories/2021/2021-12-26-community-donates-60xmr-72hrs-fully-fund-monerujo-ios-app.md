The community has donated 60 XMR in under 72 hours to fully fund the development of a Monerujo[^0] iOS proof-of-concept[^1] app from scratch:

> Witness this Christmas miracle: iOS proof of concept got funded in 3 days![^2]

> Thanks to all who contributed, and specially to a generous donor you can meet at the underground channel: t.me/monerujounderground[^3]

Other Monerujo projects[^1] are still waiting in line to be fully funded:

- Monerujo SideKick (Use an offline Android phone as a functional hardware Monero wallet)
- PocketChange (One-click creation of extra outputs allowing frequent spending)
- Support multiple colour themes (Yes - it comes with OLED Pitch Black mode)

To read more about the funding process, read my previous report[^4].
