DNSFilter[^1]'s CEO Ken Carnesi[^2] is spreading Monero FUD[^3] in an attempt to promote his own business.

He is targeting sites that have the terms *XMR* and *Monero* in their domain names:

> Sites that include the term XMR (that Monero abbreviation used in both of the domains above) are blocked via security categories on our network 43.56% of the time.

The 1st and 3rd largest Monero mining pools, MineXMR[^4] and SupportXMR[^5], were labeled *highly suspicious* based on irrelevant 3rd party *related domains* and *threat* reports:

> One of the domains that falls under that "cryptomining" category is supportxmr[dot]com. [..] This is indicative that a domain is highly suspicious

> Another domain that caused the spike in traffic is a mining pool: minexmr[dot]com. [..] according to multiple sources (in addition to our own categorization) this site has malicious intent. [..] ThreatCrowd is one site that agrees with our diagnosis where multiple users have voted that this site is in fact malicious

The quotes are from a HackerNoon article posted on Christmas Day, titled *Should You Block All Monero-Related Domains? Crypto Scams Set To Rise in 2022*[^3] that tries to scare sysadmins into blocking all access to Monero domains on their network and (conveniently) using the security tools provided by his company[^6]:

> This raises the question: Should network administrators block XMR domains on their network? If nearly 50% of them are malicious and their use is generally meant for cybercriminals and not your traditional cryptocurrency investor, thereâ€™s a strong case to be made for this decision.

He concludes the post by sending readers to a DNS comparison page on his website:

> Not all DNS security providers have a cryptomining category. Check out the benchmark report to see who does, and how they fare in head-to-head comparisons.

It is clear to me why Santa didn't visit this year: he doesn't appreciate FUD/shady marketing.
