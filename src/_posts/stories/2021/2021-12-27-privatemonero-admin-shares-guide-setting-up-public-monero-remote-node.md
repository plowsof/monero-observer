Privatemonero.org[^1] admin[^2] has shared a helpful guide[^3] to setting up your own public Monero remote node:

> I have been running my Monero remote nodes for a couple months now, so I think it's time I share how I set up my server and how you can create your own remote node to share with the Monero community.	

The guide is geared towards beginners and should work on Debian and Debian-based Linux distros.

If you have questions or feedback, post a comment in the guide's thread[^3].

Alternatively, if you just want a secure node for your wallet, you can use a Privatemonero.org node[^4].
