rimuru[^1] has proposed a bounty[^2] for the creation of Atomic Swaps-as-a-Service (ASaaS)[^3] by implementing COMIT[^4]'s swap binary functionality into the onion monero block explorer[^5]:

> I have started on a PoC [..] It is a mostly hacky solution to execute the swap binary and pull info from stdout + temp log files. Will continue to work on my branch, but feel free to create forks if it seems like something worthwhile.

```
Total Bounty: 0 XMR (to date)
```

### Use cases

- host swap as service
- run locally as as gui

### Payout criteria

- implement comit-network swap binary functionality into the onion monero block explorer
- user should be able to perform swap, history, resume, cancel etc.
- publish working code as open source to github


To start working on the project yourself, you should make your intentions public by posting a comment in the bounty's thread.

To increase the bounty you can contribute some XMR to the bounty address posted by the *Monero Bounties Bot*[^2].
