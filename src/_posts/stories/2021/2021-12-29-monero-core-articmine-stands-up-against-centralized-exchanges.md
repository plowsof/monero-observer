Monero Core's Francisco *ArticMine* Cabanas[^1] is clearly standing up[^2] against centralized exchanges by suggesting the community should *call the bluff*:

> Let them scramble to cover the shorts. [..] I smell a game of chicken here over an XMR short. [..] My take is call the bluff.

This is not the first time[^3]'[^4]'[^5]'[^6] that the Monero community has called out CEXs for their shady practices.

A boycott would imply converting everything to XMR and submitting a withdrawal request. **Users should insist on taking delivery and not sell XMR back on the exchange.** That would put the most amount of pressure on the exchange.

ArticMine definitely talks the talk and walks the walk:

> Disclosure: I do not have any funds on exchanges, I am long XMR, and all of my XMR is in my own wallet(s).

The timing of his comment is perfect, as the *Proof of Keys*[^7] day is only a couple of days away: January 3rd. But why wait?
