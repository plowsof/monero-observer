CryptoGrampy[^1] has shared a demo[^2] for his Monero Desktop Drag and Drop Widget Dashboard[^3] proof of concept:

> Just wanted to share progress on the Monero Drag and Drop Dashboard PoC I'm working on as part of a Monero Bounty [..] Zero styling yet (and widget selection will definitely change), just working out the rough ideas.

> The end goal of this is a fun and weird new way (though perhaps not the most performant) for to run a Monero node and interact with the Monero space. 

To learn more about the project and view the associated bounty, read my previous report[^4].
