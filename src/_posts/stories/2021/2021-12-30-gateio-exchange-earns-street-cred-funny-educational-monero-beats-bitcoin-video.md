Gate.io[^1] exchange has earned some street cred[^2] by uploading a funny and educational *Monero beats Bitcoin* video[^3]:

> Monero (XMR) is the best digital currency. Not only is it private and freedom respecting, but it also is more decentralized with faster transaction times at a lower price than Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency competitors.

The animated video gives an overview of the XMR blockchain, how it works, and goes over several key concepts such as: fungibility, RingCT[^4], PoW scaling and mining.
