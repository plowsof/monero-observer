*Design by gnuteardrops from monero.graphics[^1].*

Be inspired and keep building Monero, privacy and security tools in 2022. For freedom, for our friends and family, for the next generation.

> Privacy only extends so far as the cooperation of one's fellows in society. We the Cypherpunks seek your questions and your concerns and hope we may engage you so that we do not deceive ourselves. **We will not, however, be moved out of our course because some may disagree with our goals.** [..] Let us proceed together apace.[^2]

**Onward.**
