Monero contributor mjxmr[^1] has submitted his December 2021 dev report[^2] for community review:

> I was very happy to work overtime in the 1st half of December, since I knew that family matters would slow me down later on.

## Work

- Continuous Integration (CI) work
- clean up work / isolating remaining bugs

In January, mjxmr is looking to prepare a bridge for the R language, extract and publish the unique simulation features and fix remaining bugs.

mjxmr could work with hajerchebil[^3] in the near future:

> Hajer would like to bring more contributions to the project and I know her well enough, to be sure, that sheâ€™s worth it. She could do the side tasks, that I would have to do anyway, but in parallel (so in effect: sooner) and for a cheaper hourly basis than me, due to differences in experience.

> Contracting her is a separate decision from the Community though, and it will be soon presented in either her own CCS proposal, or via the MAGIC Grants.

To better understand mjxmr's CCS-related work on Monero, you can read john_r365[^4]'s *Layman's Guide*[^5].

Reports for his most recent CCS proposal[^6] and previous dev report (November 2021)[^7] are also available on Monero Observer.
