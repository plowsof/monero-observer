netrik182[^1] has posted a CCS[^2] community report[^3] for the month of December (2021):

> Hello and happy new year! As always, I would like to thank the community for their support and funding. [..] December was a good month where I could help new translators with questions in our matrix/irc room and new people started contributing.

### Work overview

- wrote a how-to guide to keep the monero-gui updated on Weblate[^4]
- opened issues in each Monero repository to configure 'webhooks'[^5]
- started trying to add screenshot 'context' to Monero GUI on Weblate[^6]

Read the full progress report[^3] for more information.

In January, netrik182 plans to push translations to Getmonero.org and look into adding Moneropedia entries to Weblate[^7].
