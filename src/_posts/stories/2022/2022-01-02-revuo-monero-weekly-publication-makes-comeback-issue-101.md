The popular *Revuo Monero*[^1] weekly publication has made a comeback with Issue #101[^2] after a 7-month hiatus:

> Revuo Monero is Back! Issue 101. Happy new year everyone![^3]

According to rottenwheel[^4], the new publication editor, we can expect a new issue every Sunday:

> Publication will be on a weekly basis, every Sunday. It will not be on rehrar's time, nor Monero Core Team dime. You will get to know who I have partnered with in a couple days.[^5]

To support Revuo Monero, you can contribute XMR to the address listed in the footer of each issue. Suggestions and comments can be sent directly to rottenwheel via email[^6].

**Update: new email address[^7].**
