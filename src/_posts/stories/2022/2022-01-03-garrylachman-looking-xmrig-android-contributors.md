garrylachman[^1] is looking[^2] for contributors and devs for his Android GUI miner *xmrig-for-android*[^3]:

> As you can see my English is ok but it's not enough for writing Product description (GitHub, Google play and etc...), Writing documentations or tutorials. If someone has some free time to help me, help the project, take part as contributor.

> Developers that want to take a part and join - it can take the project to another level. Please join :)

Version 0.0.21[^4] of the Alpha software was released today and is available in the Google Play Store[^5].

To read more about the project, consult the associated bounty[^6] and the *r/MoneroMining* thread[^2].
