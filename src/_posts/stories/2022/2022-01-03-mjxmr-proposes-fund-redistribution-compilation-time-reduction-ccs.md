Monero contributor mjxmr[^1] has proposed[^2] a redistribution of funds that are currently allocated to his *Compilation time reduction* CCS[^3]:

> My "Compilation time reduction" proposal is stuck, due to reasons different than mine, and I'd prefer to have its funds redistributed.

> Now the question is what happens to the organized funds.

As a donor you are encouraged to voice your opinion:

> However, since it’s still your money, I think you should have a voice about them, after maybe presenting your donation’s TX ID to Luigi[^4] privately?

To better understand mjxmr's CCS-related work on Monero, you can read john_r365[^5]'s *Layman's Guide*[^6] and his December 2021 dev report[^7].
