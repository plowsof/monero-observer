REMSee[^0] has shared[^1] a video[^2] in which he demonstrates a BTC-XMR atomic swap:

> [..] somebody asked me to make a tutorial video and I didn't see any other atomic swap tutorial videos online so I went ahead and made my own.

For this tutorial he uses Unstoppableswap[^3] and COMIT's `swap` tool[^4] on Windows.

To learn more about atomic swaps, consult Monero Observer's Archive[^5] for more related reports.
