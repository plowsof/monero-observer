aldrinzigmundv[^1] has released the latest version (v1.5.0)[^2] of the price monitoring CLI app *zigfi*[^3] with support for Monero:

> Made Monero as part of the default watchlist on my new free and open-source price monitoring app for stocks, commodities and crypto on GitHub.[^4]

The open source Rust software fetches the prices of stocks, commodities and cryptocurrencies using the Yahoo Finance API.

To support Aldrin's work, you can donate XMR to the address listed on his website[^5].

It is recommended to carefully inspect the code before using this app on your main machines.
