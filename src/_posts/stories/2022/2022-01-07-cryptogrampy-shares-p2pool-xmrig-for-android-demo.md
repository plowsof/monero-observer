CryptoGrampy[^1] has shared a short video[^2] in which he demonstrates *P2Pool*[^3] Monero mining on an Android device using *xmrig-for-android*[^4]:

> It's very easy (takes less than a minute!) to mine on P2Pool with an Android device running XMRig-for-Android (Simple Mode). 

Note that you will need to run P2Pool on one of your local machines or on a VPS to copy the setup in this video.

To support CryptoGrampy's work, you can contribute some XMR to the address listed in the comments section.
