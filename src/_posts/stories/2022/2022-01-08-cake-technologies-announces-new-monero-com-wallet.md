Cake Technologies[^1] has announced[^2] their new Monero-only *Monero.com*[^3] wallet, as planned[^4]:

> We are extremely excited to announce Monero.com by Cake Wallet, a Monero-only fork of Cake Wallet!

The open-source and non-custodial app can be currently downloaded for iOS[^5] and as an APK[^6] for Android.

### Features

- exchange (via ChangeNow)
- create custom names for new/restored wallets 
- batch send

### Planned

- direct fiat on-ramp to XMR
- Thorchain integration

The full wallet name (*Monero.com by Cake Wallet*) and its domain name (monero.com) can be easily confused with the official Monero website (getmonero.org) by new users, but Cake assured everyone that *there will be no confusion*:

> The site will clearly state that it is not the official site.

Cake Wallet CEO Vik Sharma[^7] has announced the new Monero-only wallet on Monerotopia Episode 47[^8]:

> [..] it's called Monero.com, the website still looks like the Cake Wallet's site, but it's gonna be completely different [..] Monero general information oriented [..] not in any way compete with Getmonero.org, of course, that's the official site .. (~48:00)

The app is currently pending approval in the Google Play store and should also be available in the F-Droid store at some point in the future (no ETA).
