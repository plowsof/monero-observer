Monero Talk[^0] host Douglas Tuman[^1] and analyst Chad Thackray[^2] focused on Monero price and its real value in the latest interview[^3]'[^4]:

> [..] the value of a network scales with the value of the nodes, we could theoretically expect something like a 25x price increase given a 5x increase in the actual usage of the network (27:20)

> [..] we were actually massively overvalued in the 2017 period because of all the hype, and now we're returing to more of a parity, fair value. That would be my bias. (28:00)

The two analyze several XMR charts and discuss transparent ledgers, security, fungibility and auditability.
