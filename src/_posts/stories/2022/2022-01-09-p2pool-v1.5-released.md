*P2Pool* version 1.5[^0] has been released with the following changes:

- Added `--out-peers`, `--in-peers` command line options and outpeers, inpeers console commands to limit the maximum number of outgoing and incoming connections
- monerod binary is removed because p2pool is supported in the official Monero releases starting from v0.17.3.0

## Wallets with P2Pool support


    Official Monero CLI and GUI v0.17.2.3 and newer
    Monerujo v2.1.0 "Vertant" and newer
    Cake Wallet v4.2.7 and newer
    MyMonero

Although P2Pool should work with the official Monero GUI v0.17.2.3, it is recommended to use it with the newest v0.17.3.1[^1] release.

Before using the software, you should verify the SHA256 sums with SChernykh[^2]'s GPG key[^3].

The README[^4] has valuable information about features, defaults, how pool shares work, build instructions and a short mining guide.

If you need assistance, you can read the FAQ[^5] and reach out to other P2Pool miners on irc[^6].
