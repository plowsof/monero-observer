The *MoneroKon 2022*[^1] CCS proposal[^2] is now ready for funding[^3]:

```
135 contributors have donated 328 of 328 XMR (100%)
```

The conference should take place in Lisbon, Portugal. 

### Notes 

- If the event is cancelled for any reason, there will be no refunds for donors:

>  [..] the CCS does not afford refunds to be paid to donors. To this effect, if the CCS is funded and the event has to be cancelled/postponed all XMR will be directed towards MoneroKon 2023. If the CCS is only partially funded - all raised XMR will be directed to the MoneroKon 2023 fund

- *Mid February* is the deadline for this proposal:

> [..] if this CCS is not funded in full by mid February (estimated date), the raised funds at that time will roll into the MoneroKon 2023 fund, maintained until 2023 by Core. 

- This is the first of 2 CCS proposals:

> This first one (CCS-1) covers the total (maximum) estimated cost of putting on the event - €55,650 (328 XMR approx @ current price of €170 per XMR - 6th January 2021).

> The second CCS (CCS-2) will cover the cost of speaker and volunteer travel and accommodation. We imagine there will be 25 total speakers and volunteers, and we have a **very rough estimate that CCS will be around €25,000. **

To support this proposal you can donate XMR to the address listed on the *Funding Required* page[^3].

Consult my previous report to learn more about this proposal[^4].
