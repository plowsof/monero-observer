Monero contributor selsta[^1] has submitted a new CCS proposal[^2] to continue working part-time on Monero development for 3 more months, until mid-March:

> Work for 30 hours per week over the next 3 months (from mid-January to mid-March) [..]

> If funded I will provide monthly updates in the CCS comment section.

He plans to focus on preparing the next network update, multisig fixes, testing and reviewing PR's and other smaller dev work on the CLI and GUI. 

selsta has contributed over 500 merged commits to both the CLI[^3] and GUI[^4] codebases since 2018.

```
Total funding needed: 95 XMR (EUR 45/hr * 30 hrs/week * 3 months).

ETA: mid-March 2022 (3 milestones).
```

You can post your comments and support this proposal on Gitlab in !279[^2].
