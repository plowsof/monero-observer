Oscar *valldrac* Mira[^1], the lead developer of Android Signal fork Molly.im[^2] has submitted the first status update[^3] for their CCS proposal[^4]:

> As two months have passed since our proposal was funded we would like to provide a status update.

### Major changes

- Users will no longer have to choose between networks (Signal vs Molly) after a multi-account feature will be implemented in the app.

- Monero payments within the Signal network will be improved and Monero wallet addresses will be automatically shared between Molly users in the Signal Network.

To learn more about the project, read the full status update[^3] and consult my previous report[^4].
