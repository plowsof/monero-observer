The OrangeFren[^1] project is looking for community feedback[^2] for their WiP crypto exchange rate comparison service:

> The key functionality of this website is to let you quickly compare the exchange rates of instant exchanges trading Monero, Bitcoin and Litecoin.

The project queries non-KYC instant exchanges and atomic swap providers for the best rate available and then redirects to the relevant website where users can initiate the trade.

On the same website you can also find their affiliation disclaimer service[^3] which generates sharable links that contain referral codes.

The users can opt to proceed to the linked service with the original referral code, a generic OrangeFren code or without any code for improved privacy. Read more about this on their Mission page[^4].

**Update: remove reference to No KYC guides, add affiliation disclaimer service mention[^3].**
