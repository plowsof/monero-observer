noot[^1]'s XMR-ETH atomic swaps[^2] CCS proposal[^3]'[^4] was finally moved to the funding stage after the community has apparently reached consensus on which license the code should be released under:

> My preference is for GPL but I will also relicense as LGPL if needed. I would like to stick with GPL or LGPL as it prevents the code from being relicensed and used in closed-source software. (noot)[^5]

> Noot would like to proceed with GPL for now but is also offering to rewrite used GPL code and change to LGPL if desired later on. (OrneryMaintenance)[^6]

ajs[^7] has opened a PR[^8] to facilitate community discussions around Monero core code licensing in parallel to the proposal:

> Proposers should not be forced into permissively licensing their work if it is not directly related to Monero code. Ultimately, donors ought to decide whether to support proposals with a copyleft license.

To learn more about this proposal, visit !277[^4] on Gitlab and read my previous report[^9]. 

To support the proposal, you can donate XMR to the address listed on its Funding[^10] page.

```
31 contributors have raised 56 of 56 XMR (100%)
```
