In this Monerotopia live session (Episode 49[^1]), Douglas Tuman[^2] and sunchakr[^3] sat down with Justin Ehrenhofer[^4] in Miami, Florida at *The North American Bitcoin Conference* (TNABC).

The event was essentially a *clown show* that featured lots of *colorful* characters which took turns at sitting down in the Monero *booth* to either shill their own projects, grab a free $10 or get a taste of the sweet Gratuitas[^5] espresso.

There was very little interest in Monero, privacy, and Bitcoin for that matter. Most people seemed to be completely new to the crypto space or they simply didn't care much for the technology.

fluffypony[^6] was right all along when he pointed out the futility of a TNABC Monero presence last month[^7]:

> It's a fun conference to meet people in this space, drink a lot (it's Miami after all), and stay up till 3am. I really don't think there is much value in Monero having a presence there. It's not a "serious" conference [..] 

> [..] they'll be more interested in earning 80 000% APY on DeFi than in their privacy.

> Also, let's not forget that this is where Dash famously sponsored an after-party at a strip club - is that really a look that we think will work for Monero? 

The only things that actually saved the day were the poor audio quality and related connection issues that prevented some of the inebriated messages from getting through.
