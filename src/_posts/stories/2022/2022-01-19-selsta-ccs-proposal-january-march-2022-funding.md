selsta[^1]'s CCS proposal[^2] to continue working part-time on Monero development for 3 more months (until mid-March) is now ready for funding:

```
34 contributors have raised 95 of 95 XMR (100%)
```

To support this proposal, you can donate some XMR to the address listed on the *selsta-4.html* Gitlab page[^3].

To learn more about selsta's work, consult my previous reports[^4]'[^5].

**Update: proposal was fully funded.**
