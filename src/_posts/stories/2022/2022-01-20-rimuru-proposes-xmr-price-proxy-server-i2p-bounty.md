rimuru[^1] has proposed a bounty[^2] for the creation of an XMR price proxy server over I2P:

> Created a sample node.js server that provides XMR -> BTC price data over i2p. Sample client code as well. Not sure how much benefit it can provide for increasing privacy as opposed to fetching price over clearnet. It seems like the more the merrier.

> Perhaps in the future it could aggregate price data from atomic swap sellers, to have a decentralized price feed.

```
Total Bounty: 0 XMR (to date)
```

rimuru has already shared a WiP[^3] that pulls price data for XMR over I2P from a proxy server.

### Minimum requirements

- user can host a price proxy server over i2p with xmr -> btc price
- user can receive payment and authenticate clients with a tx proof
- code is open source on github

### Payout criteria

- verified by other users / developers


To start working on the project yourself, you should make your intentions public by posting a comment in the bounty's thread.

To increase the bounty you can contribute some XMR to the bounty address posted by the *Monero Bounties Bot*[^2].
