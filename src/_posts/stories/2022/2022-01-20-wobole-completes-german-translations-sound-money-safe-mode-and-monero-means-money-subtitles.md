Wobole[^1] has completed[^2] the German translations of *Sound Money, Safe Mode*[^3] and *Monero Means Money*[^4] subtitles:

> I deeply apologize for the huge delay, this shouldn't have happened, yet it did. To try to make up for this, I'll take a look at the German translation of the Website to review or rather translate the suggestions/pending strings.

According to the associated CCS proposal[^5], the work initially had an estimated delivery time of *maximum of two months* (~October 2021).

Around 23704 words/3269 strings[^6]'[^7] are ready to be reviewed by German speakers in the community.
