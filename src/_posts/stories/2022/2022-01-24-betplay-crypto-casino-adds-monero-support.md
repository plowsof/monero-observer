Betplay[^1] crypto casino has added support for Monero on their platform:

> We want to inform you that Betplay.io now supports Monero cryptocurrency. We have all top-tier providers and offer our players 
a 100% welcome bonus and 10% weekly cashback![^2]

The platform offers slots, table games, live dealer games, poker freerolls and other games.

All games are played in USD:

> The game does not support playing in Monero directly. Balance, bets and wagers will be presented using corresponding US Dollar value. All bets & winnings in US Dollar are applied to your account with the corresponding Monero value.

Users can currently deposit XMR, BTC, ETH, LTC, Dogecoin, Solana and TRON.

It is unclear if Monero cashouts are enabled at this point, but the minimum withdraw amount is 0.03 (probably BTC, not specified).

Note that Betplay is a relatively new player in the industry:

> Betplay was born in the summer of 2020 by a group of gaming professionals for crypto currency enthusiasts.[^3]
