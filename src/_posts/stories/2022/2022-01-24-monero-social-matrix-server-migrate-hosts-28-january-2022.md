The core team-hosted *Monero.social*[^1] Matrix server will migrate to a new host on 28 January 2022 at 0100 AM GMT:

> The matrix server hosted by the core team, accessible at monero.social, will undertake a migration to a new host, on Friday Jan 28th, 1:00AM GMT. All data should be copied over, so apart from the short downtime it should be hopefully painless. (binaryFate)[^2]

Expected downtime is 1-2 hours[^3].

**Update: migration completed, with some (minor) issues.**
