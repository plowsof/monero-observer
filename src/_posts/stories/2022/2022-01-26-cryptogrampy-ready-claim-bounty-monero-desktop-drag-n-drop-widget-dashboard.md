CryptoGrampy[^1] has shared a final demo[^2] for his Monero Desktop Drag and Drop Widget Dashboard proof of concept[^3] and is now ready to claim the associated bounty[^4]:

> The project itself is a fairly functional sketch of a savable/customizable dashboard that can manage Monero-y things like Monerod, as well as be sort of a gateway into Monero community happenings like Monero Art Fund, Monero radio stations, funding mechanisms, mining, news etc, through simple Widgets.[^5]

The app was built with Electron and Angular and is very much *Alpha*. 

Devs and advanced users are encouraged to get involved, use the build instructions and submit PR's on Github[^3].

To support CryptoGrampy's work, you can contribute some XMR to the bounty address posted by the *Monero Bounties Bot*[^4] or to his OpenAlias Monero payment address[^6].

**Update: bounty was paid.**
