moneroguides[^1] has announced a delay[^2] in the completion of the *Getting to grips with Monero* CCS proposal[^3] until March 1st 2022:

> Unfortunately we are going to have to take an unexpected break from this work. At present it looks like it will take a few more weeks, with a new completion target of March 1st.

Originally, the work was estimated to take around 6 weeks (early February).

The Monero community could use this opportunity to get involved with the project by proofreading and commenting on the existing video scripts[^4].

Consult my previous report to learn more about this proposal[^5].

**Update: work restarted, ETA: early March[^6].**
