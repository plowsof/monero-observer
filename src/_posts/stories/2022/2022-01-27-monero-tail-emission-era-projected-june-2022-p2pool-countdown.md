Monero's tail emission *era*[^1] is projected to start in June 2022 (~8th) according to the new P2Pool[^2] countdown page[^3] created by SChernykh[^4]:

> It gets data (current emission and block height) from monerod every minute and updates the numbers using the actual block reward formula, so it should be accurate.[^5]

When that happens, Monero will have a fixed block reward of 0.6 XMR per block, *forever*.
