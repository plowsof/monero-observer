Trezor[^1] has backtracked[^2] on the integration of *Address Ownership Proof Protocol* into their product after community backlash[^3] and is now promising to remove all AOPP support in February 2022[^4]:

> After careful consideration of recent feedback, we will be removing Address Ownership Proof Protocol (AOPP) in the next Trezor Suite update.

> We underestimated how this feature would be received, and we are against the regulations that concern AOPP.

> Our company operates with maximum transparency and we did not expect this feature to be controversial. 

PR #4825[^5] proposes the removal of all code related to the AOPP integration:

> This PR removes AOPP support from Trezor Suite completely.

Other wallets are also planning to remove AOPP: Sparrow[^6]'[^7] and BlueWallet[^8].

Samourai Wallet, the only project that vehemently refused to comply and didn't even consider integrating AOPP, has hosted a livestream[^9] dedicated to discussing the issue at length:

> We hosted a live discussion with our community this morning about the AOPP and the broader implications of regulatory capture of bitcoin self custody.[^10]
