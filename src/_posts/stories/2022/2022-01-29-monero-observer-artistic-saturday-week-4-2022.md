This is the first *Artistic Saturday* weekly MO report. Each Saturday I will select the top 5 Monero art/graphics/animations/memes from around the community.

Hopefully this can stimulate participation by promoting existing artistic efforts in our ecosystem. You can help by tipping artists that list an XMR address.

### 5 - Monero Birdie (animation by mycowild[^1])

### 4 - Tribute to my favorite coin I don't own. (meme by SkaldCrypto[^2])

That's it for this week's *Artistic Saturday*.

Let me know if you like the concept and send me your art suggestions @[/about](/about). 

Note that AFAIK only the monero.graphics art can be used freely, according to their license. Contact the other artists to get more information.
