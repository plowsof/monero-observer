Monero enthusiast spirobel[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2] to write a Monero Afghanistan expansion strategy paper:

> This proposal is for a strategy paper that explores how Monero adoption can be increased in Afghanistan. It will be split into three parts, that sum up to roughly 15-30 pages.

```
Funding needed: 15 XMR
ETA: 4-8 weeks
```

### Chapters

- Chapter 1 - Quantitative look at the Afghan market: remittances, remote work, internet availability
- Chapter 2 - Qualitative look at remote work potential, local cash to monero markets
- Chapter 3 - Lowering the barrier to Monero adoption: possible solutions for the most pressing needs

If the CCS proposal makes it to funding, Meena, a pseudonymous remote freelancer that is currently residing in Afghanistan, will help spirobel write this paper.

spirobel has previously won a bounty after creating a Monero tutorial video[^3]. 

You can post your comments and support this proposal on Gitlab in !282[^2].
