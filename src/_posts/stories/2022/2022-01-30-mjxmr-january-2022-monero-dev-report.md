Monero contributor mjxmr[^1] has posted his January 2022 dev report[^2] for community review:

> For the last 3 months I’ve been >90% dedicated to deliver a minimal but, at the same time, usable version of my tsqsim, which is meant to support Monero Researchers in building prediction models.

Hajer[^3] was looking to contribute to the project, but according to mjxmr, she decided against it:

> However what I absolutely need to mention is, that my friend, Hajer, decided that she wouldn’t be able to handle the side tasks specially selected for her, complaining about her lack of the necessary experience.

To better understand mjxmr's CCS-related work on Monero, you can read john_r365[^4]'s *Layman's Guide*[^5].

Reports for his most recent CCS proposal[^6] and previous dev update (December 2021)[^7] are also available on Monero Observer.
