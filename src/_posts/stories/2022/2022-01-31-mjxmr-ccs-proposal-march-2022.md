Monero contributor mjxmr[^1] has submitted a new CCS proposal[^2] to continue working on Monero Core[^3] part-time for 3 more months in 2022:

- weekly review of PRs
- check if the Continuous Integration works fine
- be available for the Team per request
- keep generating the Monero health report[^5] as new branches get merged

```
Total funding needed: 126 XMR (45 EUR/h * 30 h/week * 4 weeks * 3 months / 128 XMR/EUR).

ETA (period): 3 months (starting mid-February/March 2022).
