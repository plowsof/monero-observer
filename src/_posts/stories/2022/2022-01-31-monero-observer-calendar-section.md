A Monero Observer **Calendar**[^1] section is now available on the website. The aim is to separate Monero community meetings from other events.

Hopefully this makes it easier to:

- view and join upcoming meetings
- access logs for previous meetings
- compile my monthly blitz report

Let me know if you find this useful and send suggestions to me, preferrably via XMPP.
