*Exodus Wallet*[^1] is planning[^2] to add support for Monero on the *Trezor*[^3] by the end of June 2022:

> I'm pleased to share we're going to support Monero on the Trezor! 

> Development will start in March. We plan on shipping support by the end of June 2022.

Exodus can function as a Trezor bridge[^4] and both *Trezor One*[^5] & *Model T*[^6] should work with the wallet:

> Exodus also functions as a Trezor bridge, but that doesn't support all of the assets that Exodus itself does. Monero was requested for Trezor support pretty publicly, so we've added it to our roadmap.[^7]

Note that Exodus is **not** open source[^8] and Trezor has been under fire recently[^9].
