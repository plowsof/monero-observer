*Harsh Strongman* (LifeMathMoney)[^1] has added a Monero module[^2] to his *Learn Crypto Course*[^3] and is now looking for community feedback[^4]:

> We recently (i.e. today) added a module on "Privacy Coins" to our free crypto course and covered Monero in full detail in there.

> I'd love to hear what you guys think and if you have any suggestions to improve the module for everyone!

The Indian crypto enthusiast was a MoneroTalk guest[^5] in December 2021.
