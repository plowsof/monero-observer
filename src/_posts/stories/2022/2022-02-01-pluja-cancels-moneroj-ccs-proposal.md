pluja[^0] has cancelled[^1] their CCS funding proposal[^2] to build the *Moneroj.info*[^3] project:

> I have been thinking about closing this CCS proposal and leaving the project to volunteer donations from users who really use it or find it useful. I no longer see the point of directly asking for fund from the community; I love doing this, and I want to do it in an altruist wayâ€¦ I don't really feel comfortable asking for funding.

The first version will be ready *very soon* and pluja is planning to rely only on XMR donations to support the project:

> A donation page will be available on the project (like I have on my other projects), so anybody can donate to it easily and that will be more than enough to pay my work :)
