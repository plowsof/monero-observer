The Haveno[^1] team has submitted the second largest CCS[^2] proposal ever, looking to raise $231,000 USD (1543 XMR) for front-end development:

> While work on the backend is ongoing, we found ourselves with the need of a dedicated and skilled frontend team for building the user interface. After a scrupulous research, we decided to work with Viabl, a skilled team with decades of frontend development in their portfolio.

```
Total funding proposed: $231,000 (1543 XMR).

ETA (period): 4-6 months (TBD).
```

### If fully funded 

The funds are to be sent to Haveno every month for 4 months, with the first milestone payment upfront:

> For simplicity, we ask the funds to be sent to us every month for 4 months, with the first reward being sent as soon as our proposal is considered funded. 

Provided the development costs turn out to be lower, excess funds will be used for:

- GDPR analysis of Haveno (~$10K)
- Audit of the trade protocol
- Audit of Monero multisignature
- other CCS proposals & the General Fund

Haveno would post progress reports on Github and on Matrix/IRC chatrooms[^3].

### If not fully funded 

The team proposes that the CCS proposal should not be considered a fail:

> This means if the ccs won't be fully funded, won't be considered failed, but partly funded. In that case we will explore other ways to gather the remaining needed funds.

### Disclaimers

> The operative exchange running Haveno will be for-profit. Meaning the collected fees will go to the operators of the exchange.

> The Haveno core team won't run the operative exchange. That will be done by another entity.

The community is currently assessing the viability of this CCS proposal on Gitlab[^2] and Reddit[^4].

This is the second largest CCS proposal to date, only trailing the *Monero Atomic Swaps implementation*[^5] funding proposal, which is still a WiP since October 2020.
