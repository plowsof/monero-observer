Sethforprivacy[^1] has called out[^2] Haseeb Qureshi[^3] for spreading Monero *FUD* with his recent piece for Coindesk[^4]'s *Privacy Week*[^5] titled *4 Reasons Privacy Coins Haven't Taken Off*[^6]:

> I don't usually do threads like this where I take a negative stance on someone elses writing, but there was just far too much here that I staunchly disagree with that needed to be mentioned.[^7]

Seth points out several flaws in the author's analysis of Monero and privacy, including:

1 - *BTC is still the asset of choice [on DNMs]*

**This is false.**

As Seth points out:

> The author uses outdated stats and a single adoption metric, missing the real data.

> [XMR] has taken almost total dominance on DNMs -- up to 84% in 2021 and becoming the only option.

2 - *Ethereum-based privacy systems like Tornado Cash have so much uptake in comparison [to privacy coins]*

**This is also false.**

Seth got it right:

> The article fails to mention any of the transactional statistics or rise in usage for Monero, and instead points to the "rising uptake" of TornadoCash, a privacy tool on Ethereum that had barely more than 4k withdrawals in January, while Monero had over 700k transactions.

The data is pretty clear:

- TornadoCash had exactly 4637 withdrawals in January 2022[^8].

- Monero had more than 730K+ transactions during the same period[^9].

3 - *[internalizing] the costs of privacy on the users who actually care about it rather than forcing everyone to bear the costs of privacy [is good]*

**Wrong again!**

It's the other way around: optional privacy is harmful to the anonymity sets of participants that opt-in to privacy features. 

I fully agree with Seth: 

> [..] privacy *requires* buy-in from the whole system [..] 

Monero's privacy by default is a core fundamental value that protects everyone's privacy. This should not be sacrificed in the name of convenience.

There is more: read the original article[^6] and Sethforprivacy's full Twitter thread[^2] if you need more information to form your own opinion on this matter.

Make sure to keep this in mind when reading Haseeb's piece:

> The last point, and potentially the most objective, is that the author has a vested interest in turning people away from Monero and to Ethereum/Bitcoin, as he is a large investor in many Ethereum/DeFi projects: dcp.capital/portfolio[^10]
