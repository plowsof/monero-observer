tobtoht[^1] has given up on the self-hosted Gitea instance[^2] and decided to move the official git repository containing *Feather Wallet*[^3]'s code to Github[^4]:

> This was done to make it easier to attract new contributors, allow us to make 
use of GitHub actions, and spend less time maintaining the Gitea instance.[^5]

The PGP signed message also mentioned that the old repository will no longer be updated and will be deleted eventually.
