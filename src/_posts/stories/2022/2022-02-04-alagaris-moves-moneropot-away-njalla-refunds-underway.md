Alagaris[^1] has successfully moved the *MoneroPot*[^2] raffle website to a new server and domain name[^3] as Njalla[^4] seemingly failed to restore services after last week's disruption[^5]:

> My domain and server just seems to have disappeared. It's still listed under my account but can't do anything with it.[^6]

January 2022 refunds are underway:

> I have now moved the server to a new location.

> I still don't have access to the old server so I can't easily re-apply your entries if you made one on January 2022. Please send me a contact us at https://moneropot.org for fastest refund with your txid, amount and monero address to send it to.

To learn more about the project, consult my previous report[^7].
