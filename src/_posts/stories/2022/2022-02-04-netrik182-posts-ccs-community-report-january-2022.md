netrik182[^1] has posted a CCS[^2] community report[^3] for the month of January (2022):

> This month I was a little bit busier then usual with other activities outside of Monero and that's why I delayed this report a bit. Most things will be resolved next week so February should be fine.

### Work overview

- submitted PR to update translations for Monero GUI Wallet[^4]
- Moneropedia entries were added to Weblate and all of them can be easily translated as of 11st January[^5]

Read the full progress report[^3] for more information.

netrik182 has invited community members that speak a second language to contribute to the Monero Project by joining *#monero-translations* on Matrix and IRC/Libera[^6].
