The *MoneroKon 2022*[^1] CCS proposal[^2] is 87% funded with ~7 days left until the set dealine:

```
95 contributors have donated ~286 of 328 XMR (so far)
```

If the proposal is not fully funded by mid February (13-15), we will not have a MoneroKon this year and the raised funds will roll into the MoneroKon 2023 fund.

There is still time to support this proposal by donating XMR to the address listed on the *Funding Required* page[^3].

Consult my previous report to learn more about this proposal[^4].

You can also join the next *MoneroKon 2022 Planning Meeting*[^5] on Sunday, 13th of February.
