The COMIT[^1] team is no longer maintaining the XMR-BTC atomic swap project[^2].

> It's not easy to communicate this... We are struggling to maintain github.com/comit-network/xmr-btc-swap and are looking for maintainers.[^3]

The project is currently looking for contributors with Rust knowledge that can step up to the challenge and become maintainers:

> If you love the XMR-BTC swap tool, have some Rust knowledge and are willing to step up please reach out and we are happy to discuss making you a maintainer.

> We are currently partnering with ItchySats building trustless CFD trading using DLCs on Bitcoin. This requires all of our brainpower and time.

You can read the full announcement on the COMIT blog[^4] and get in touch with the community on Matrix[^5].
