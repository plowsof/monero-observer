Monero artist Crypt0-Bear[^1] has released his newest album titled *Make Crypto Scary Again*. It is available to download[^2] for free on the dark web from the *Milk Road*[^3] anonymous marketplace:

> Releasing my new album for free on the darkweb. Download Tor and go get yourself a copy[^4]

### Top [spoiler] tracks

```
The System
Out The Matrix 
VIP in the Gulag
[..]
```

The album will also be released on the clear web on the 25th of February:

> I made this site so that I could offer free downloads for my existing fans, My new album "Make Crypto Scary Again" comes out on February 25th but I have uploaded it for free on the downloads page.[^5]

Fans can opt to download the rapper's older albums on *The Monero Bay* downloads[^6] page, such as *The Orange Album* and *Bitcoin Yolo Rap*.

It looks like[^7] he is also planning to start a crypto podcast that focuses on the cypherpunk ideals and episodes should be available over tor and possibly even i2p.  

You can support Crypt0-Bear by donating to his XMR address (listed on the about[^5] page).
