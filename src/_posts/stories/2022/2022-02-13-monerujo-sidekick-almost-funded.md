The Monerujo SideKick[^1] project is almost fully funded and at this point it looks like the Android app will soon become a reality:

```
Raised 133.15 of 179 XMR   ~75%   Contributors: 96
```

> Monerujo Sidekick is an Android app which is a functional replacement for dedicated Monero hardware wallets.

> SideKick is run on a separate Android device without internet connectivity. It is a companion app to regular Monerujo. The SideKick holds the wallet keys and is never connected to the internet thus keeping the keys offline & safe.

To learn more about the project, consult my previous report[^2], the Reddit thread[^3] and the closed CCS proposal[^4].

To contribute to the project, donate some XMR to the address listed on the Monerujo Funding Site[^1].
