Top[^0] Monero mining pool, MineXMR[^1], saw its hashrate drop from 50% to 38% (~1.62 Gh/s to ~1.24 Gh/s)[^2] after the Monero community united in an effort[^3] to strengthen the network and keep it decentralized.

xnbya[^4], MineXMR's admin, is planning to cooperate by bumping the pool fee from 1% to 1.1% (+10%) starting April 1st 2022:

> We understand that people are concerned with the large hashrate that minexmr currently has. We have announced an increase to the pool fees and continue to monitor the situation.[^5]

> Planned changes to Pool Fee: The pool fee will increase from 1% to 1.1% on April 1

However, the community is not convinced[^6]'[^7] when it comes to the efficiency of the proposed increase percentage and its timeline.

There is **no evidence**[^8]'[^9]'[^10] that the Monero network is currently under attack, but the threat is definitely not imaginary.

Miners are invited to join the effort and use P2Pool[^11] instead of MineXMR and other top centralized pools. 

Consult my previous reports[^12]'[^13]'[^14] for demos and guides if you need help getting started with P2Pool.

For more information, read dEBRUYNE_1[^15]'s excellent post[^3] and submit your comment in that thread.
