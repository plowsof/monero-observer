mjxmr[^1] has submitted a new CCS proposal[^2] for Q2 2022 that essentially replaces !283[^3]:

> I propose to work for 3 months, spending 30 hours a week on Monero Core and Monero GUI [..]

### Planned work

- reviewing the Monero Core and GUI code
- enabling and helping new developers
- providing more documentation for new devs
- CI fixes
- addressing user issues (whenever I can help)
- benchmarking tsqsim (although this one is arguable)
- regenerating and extending my Monero health report
- adding Monero-GUI to the health report
- general firefighting, whatever problems we face in near future


mjxmr has been contributing to Monero Core since 2020. More details about his work can be found in his previous proposal[^4]'s progress report[^5] and on Github[^6].

```
Total funding needed: 102 XMR (45 EUR/h * 30 h/week * 4 weeks * 3 months / 156 XMR/EUR).

ETA (period): 3 months (starting ~March 2022).
```

To share your feedback, ask questions, learn more and support this proposal, consult !287[^2].
