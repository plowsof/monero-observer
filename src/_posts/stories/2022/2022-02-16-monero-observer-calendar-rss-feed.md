A Monero Observer **Calendar** feed[^1] is now available on the RSS[^2] page. 

This can be useful if you want to keep up with community meetings[^3] in a separate thread.

### Notes

- meetings are currently sorted by post date, not by meeting date
- only most recent meetings are included (consult the Archive[^4] to see all previous meetings)

Feedback and suggestions are always welcome @ [/about](/about).
