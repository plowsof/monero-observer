moneroguides[^1] has resumed work[^2] on their *Getting to grips with Monero* mini series CCS proposal[^3] and we can expect an update very soon:

> I'd like to let you all know that work has recommenced on the series. If all goes well, it should be completed for the first week of March. Sorry for the delays!

This comes after a delay that was announced[^4] 3 weeks ago.

Consult my previous report to learn more about this proposal[^5].

**Update: delayed, according to new announcement[^6].**
