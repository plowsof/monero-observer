*MAGIC Grants*[^1]'s Monero Fund[^2]'[^3] has started accepting applications for research grants focused on improving the Monero protocol and ecosystem, according to an announcement[^4] from advisory committee member Rucknium[^5]:

> Applications are accepted on a rolling basis. The MAGIC Monero Fund anticipates funding requests of the equivalent of 5,000 to 20,000 USD at this time. Note that recipients of grants will have to submit identity information to MAGIC Grants as part of compliance with U.S. Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations.

To learn more about the application process, read the *Research-Grant-RFP.md*[^6] document on Github.
