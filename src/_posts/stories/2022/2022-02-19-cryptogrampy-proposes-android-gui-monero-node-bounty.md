CryptoGrampy[^1] has proposed a bounty[^2] for the creation of an Android GUI Monero node:

> There are Termux scripts for running Monerod on Android (https://github.com/CryptoGrampy/android-termux-monero-node), but I would like to see a GUI that makes this process even easier. There are millions of phones out there that are capable of running nodes and a GUI Monero node helps bring those phones into the network. 

To view the proposed minimum requirements and start working on the project yourself, you should make your intentions public by posting a comment in the bounty's thread[^2].

Alternatively you can contribute some XMR to the bounty address posted by the *Monero Bounties Bot*. Your donation will be reflected in the comments.


```
Total Bounty: TBD
```
