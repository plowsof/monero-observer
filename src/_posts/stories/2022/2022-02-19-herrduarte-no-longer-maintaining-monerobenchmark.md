herrduarte[^1] has announced[^2] their plans to stop maintaining Monerobenchmarks.info[^3] after 5 years[^4]:

> When I started, monero was just around $8 [..] I thank all the community and everyone who visited and supported the site. Also thanks to all miners for submitting their results, I will no longer run site due to personal reasons but i am going to keep an eye on monero as I really use it. 

The website was being used by users to check and submit GPU and CPU scores.

herrduarte plans to update the thread with links to a dump of the data for everyone to access.
