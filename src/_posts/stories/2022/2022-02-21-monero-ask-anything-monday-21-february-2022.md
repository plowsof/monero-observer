This week's *MAAM* thread[^1] on Reddit is now open. 

> The principle is simple: ask anything you'd like to know about Monero, especially the dumb questions that you've been keeping for you every other days, may the community clarify it all!

If you are looking for links to useful projects and contacts in the Monero community, consult the *Resources*[^2] page on Monero Observer.
