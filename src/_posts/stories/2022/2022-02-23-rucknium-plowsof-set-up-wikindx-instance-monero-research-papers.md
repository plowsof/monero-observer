Monero contributors Rucknium[^1] and plowsof[^2] have set up a WIKINDX[^3] instance at Moneroresearch.info[^4] that will store Monero-related research papers:

> It's a place to collect Monero-related papers and annotate them. My hope is that it can help onboard new researchers and help us establish a workflow for reviewing new papers that are written about Monero.[^5]

Tor users can opt to access the onion[^6] address of the website.

While anyone can browse existing papers, only registered users can create new entries, edit existing entries and add annotations.

Registration is currently disabled, but you can contact Rucknium on Matrix[^7] if you are interested in registering an account.
