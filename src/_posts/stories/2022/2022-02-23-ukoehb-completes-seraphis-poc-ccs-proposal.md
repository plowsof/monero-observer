MRL's UkoeHB[^1] has completed[^2] their Seraphis C++ proof-of-concept CCS proposal[^3]:

> Hi everyone, I have more-or-less completed all the work I set out to do in this CCS (total time spent on Monero stuff since making the proposal: 320 hrs).

Read the full dev update[^2] on Gitlab and consult my previous report[^4] to learn more about this proposal.

UkoeHB plans to open a new CCS proposal for `seraphis_lib` work very soon.

**Update: new CCS proposal submitted[^5].**
