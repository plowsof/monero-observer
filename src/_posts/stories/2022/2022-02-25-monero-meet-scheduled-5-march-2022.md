The next Monero Meet livestream[^1] is scheduled to take place on Saturday, March 5th 2022, probably at 2000 UTC (2 PM CT).

The host is *TBD*, as Justin[^2] is currently looking for someone else to host the event:

> I can get you the creds/code/etc to be able to stream to youtube, or you can do a non-live version that I can upload. The host should be able to do basic OBS tasks. I can help with the VDO.ninja setup [..]
 
Post in the *#monero-space*[^3] Matrix room if you're interested in this task. 
 
The Monero Space[^4] workgroup usually holds Monero Meet livestreams approximately every 4 weeks which feature active members of the community answering questions from others.
