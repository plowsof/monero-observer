reemuru[^1] has released v0.1.0[^2] of the experimental lightweight XMR browser extension *himitsu*[^3]:

> This release is the first of many for the Himitsu client / Monero browser extension. This is currently a dev wallet primarily used for quickly interfacing and testing integration between React.js and the monero-wallet-rpc.

The software is not intended for mainnet use, there is no Windows support and it only works on Brave. 

It is also worth noting that this currently requires a custom binary which is included and built on the latest Fedora 35 kernel.

Consult the GH repository[^2]'[^3] to view features, planned integrations, known bugs and build instructions.
