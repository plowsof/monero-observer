XMR.radio[^1] is planning to broadcast live talks from the upcoming MoneroKon 2022[^2] event, according to their third quarterly transparency report[^3]:

> XMR.radio plans to live broadcast talks from MoneroKon 2022 this June from Lisbon, Portugal, in addition to streaming DJ mixes from the after party on MixCloud.

You can listen to the community-ran Monero radio through tor[^4] by following the quick guide[^5] on their website.

If you're a DJ and want to schedule a mix session, send a DM on Twitter[^6] and join the Matrix chatroom[^7].

The station had to downscale their operation in November[^8], so if you want to see XMR.radio online after July 2022, you have the option to tip some Monero on their crowdfunding page[^9].
