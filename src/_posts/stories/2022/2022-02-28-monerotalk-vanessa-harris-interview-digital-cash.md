In this Monero Talk episode[^1]'[^2], Douglas Tuman interviews Vanessa Harris[^3] on why society needs true digital cash:

> [..] the number 1 currency that's used for illicit activity by far and away is the US dollar [..] the idea that having somehow an untraceable digital cash is gonna be the cause of all this activity, to me that's just ridiculous .. (09:45)

> [..] CBDC is the end of human liberty. (35:45)

The guest is the CPO of Permission[^4], a platform for *Web3 advertising*, and an ex-Google and ex-Microsoft employee.

Several topics are covered in this interview, such as: government tyranny, CBDC's, privacy, fungibility, governance, self custody, surveillance capitalism, Monero and BTC.
