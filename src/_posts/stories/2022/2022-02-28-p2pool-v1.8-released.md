Before using the software, you should verify the SHA256 sums with SChernykh[^2]'s GPG key[^3].

The README[^4] has valuable information about features, defaults, how pool shares work, build instructions and a short mining guide.

If you need assistance, you can read the FAQ[^5] and reach out to other P2Pool miners on irc[^6].
