Winston[^1] has submitted a new CCS proposal[^2] to build a FOSS Android app called *Whatnero*:

> It will encompass all of the available information regarding Monero in a user-friendly manner so that newcomers can easily access all of the information to learn about Monero and get started.

```
Total funding: 100 XMR.

ETA: TBD.
```

### Milestones

- Milestone 1: Guides and Info (45 XMR)
- Milestone 2: Design and Development (45 XMR)
- Milestone 3: Final Testing and Release (10 XMR)

If this is funded, the app should be released via F-droid and the Play Store.

Winston has previously created a FOSS app called *Simpill*[^3] and written some Monero guides: *How to Create a Paper XMR Wallet*[^4] and *How to Use P2Pool*[^5].

To share your feedback, ask questions and support this proposal, consult !293[^2].
