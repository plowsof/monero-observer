The new RINO[^1] Monero multisig wallet is looking[^2] for stagenet testers:

> The first of its kind, RINO is a new type of Monero wallet: non-custodial, enterprise-grade, based on multisig. 

> As soon as it becomes possible, we’ll go live with our mainnet version. In the meantime, we’re keen to get your feedback if you feel like having fun with our stagenet version.

Monero Core's binaryFate[^3] has confirmed that he is involved with the project:

> I can confirm I'm involved with RINO. Excited to see it going public![^4]

> Think BitGo or Fireblocks, for #Monero[^5]

The RINO team can be reached on Reddit[^6], Twitter[^7] and via email[^8].

Unfortunately, the project's website is currently inaccessible via tor.
