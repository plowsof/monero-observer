UkoeHB[^1] has won a $1K bounty[^2] after the Haveno[^3]-sponsored multisig pull request #7877[^4] was merged[^5] into Monero:

> The work we sponsored for improving #Monero's multisig implementation just got merged! This will be a huge improvement to anyone using multisignatures, not only Haveno! Thanks UkoeHB for working on this![^6]

The resulting significant improvement to Monero's multisig[^7] implementation will affect the upcoming Haveno DEX[^3], the new RINO[^8] wallet and any other existing and future projects in the Monero ecosystem that use multisignatures. 

This was made possible by everyone who has been contributing to this PR for the past ~6 months, by testing, documenting and reviewing the code: rbrunner7[^9], erciccione[^10], iamamyth[^11], moneromooo[^12], h4sh3d[^13], vtnerd[^14] and tmoravec[^15]. Changes were approved by selsta[^16] and finally merged by luigi1111[^17].

UkoeHB is currently looking for help (reviews/tests) with a new Monero pull request (#8203)[^18] that aims to optimize multisig account creation. There is an active Haveno bounty[^19] on this issue as well.
