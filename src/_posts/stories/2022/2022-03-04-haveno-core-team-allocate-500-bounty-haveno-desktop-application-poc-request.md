Haveno core team (erciccione[^1] and woodser[^2]) have allocated a $500 bounty for the Haveno desktop application PoC request[^3]:

> The application will bundle at least Haveno's backend daemon, web front end (see poc), monerod, and monero-wallet-rpc.

> Two options to consider are Electron and Tauri Studio.

Anyone can participate and the bounty will be awarded to the first person who resolves this issue.

Before starting any work, a comment in #255[^3] is necessary, so the issue can be assigned to you.

Full conditions can be found in the `bounties.md`[^4] file.
