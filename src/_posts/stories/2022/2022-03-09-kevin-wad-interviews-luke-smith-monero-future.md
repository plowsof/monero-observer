Kevin Wad[^1] has interviewed[^2] Luke Smith[^3] on the future of Monero:

> Kevin Wad asked me to do an interview. We're releasing it here first.

> [..] I do not want digital things to be mandatory [..] I wanna be able to pay with something physical. [..] with something where I know there's not gonna be any metadata leakage because there is no metadata. [..] and in the realm of digital technology we got to do it right, and that's what Monero is. (Luke @ 1:18:00)

> [..] when I look at why I endorse Monero, it is primarily because of dystopia avoidance [..] (Luke @ 1:20:20)

The two address various topics, including: the fiat system, maximalism, taxes and regulation, censorship, BTC, importance of hard money and the next global currency.

The interview will also be uploaded to Kevin's video channel[^4] soon.
