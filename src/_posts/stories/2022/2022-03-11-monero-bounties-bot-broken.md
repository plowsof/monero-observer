The bot that was responsible with posting XMR addresses on Monero.Bounties[^1] is temporarily broken, but it should be back online soon, according to project founder Sethforprivacy[^2]:

> A bot is supposed to post an address but seem broken ATM, I will circle back on that now.[^3]

Also due to this issue, donations will not be reflected in the comments sections of bounties.

It is recommended to **not** donate to Monero addresses that are manually posted by users on the website until the bot is back online.

I will update the report when the status changes.
