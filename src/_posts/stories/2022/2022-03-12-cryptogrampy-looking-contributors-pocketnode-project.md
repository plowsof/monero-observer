CryptoGrampy[^1] is looking[^2] for contributors to help build PocketNode[^3], a simple Monero GUI node for Android:

> The goal here is to make a very simple to use, low-power/cheap Monero node that caters to newbies. It will have sane defaults, a nice UI, and I would like to provide simple instructions on how a person could expose the node through Orbot as a hidden service.  

If you have experience with Android development and wish to contribute to the project, consult the code repository[^3] and open some PRs.

**Update: alpha release .apk now available[^4] for testing purposes.**
