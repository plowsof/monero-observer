hinto-janaiyo[^1] has released v1.2[^2] of XMRig-Auto-Build[^3], a user-friendly interactive bash script that builds the latest XMRig[^4] from source:

> XMRig-Auto-Build installs build dependencies, builds the required libraries, builds a portable XMRig binary using those libraries, and then (optionally) cleans up all the source code leaving behind XMRig and the config.json.

> Currently, the XMRig repo does contain build scripts, however the process might not be easy for a beginner.[^5]

The tool is available only for Linux users: Debian, Mint, Pop!_OS, Arch, Fedora and any other distro that uses `apt`, `pacman` or `dnf` package managers.

To get started with XMRig-Auto-Build, consult the README.md[^6] in the project's code repository.

It is recommended to review the bash script code[^7] before usage.

To support the dev and the project, you can donate XMR to the address listed on GH[^8].
