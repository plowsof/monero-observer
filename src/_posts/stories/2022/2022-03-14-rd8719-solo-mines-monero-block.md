rd8719[^1] bagged 0.67 XMR after solo mining a block with the built-in Monero GUI wallet miner:

> I solo mined a block in less than a week. Using a single PC with a Ryzen 5 3600. Around 2500 H/s.[^2]

> I'm using GUI version r0.17.3.1-release (Qt 5.15.2).

As other community members have pointed out, rd8719 got very lucky with this unlikely win. 

This is especially remarkable as the miner was only using a fraction of the CPU's potential and they have started mining less than a week ago.
