The Haveno[^1] team has submitted a new CCS[^2] proposal for front-end development:

> We are asking for 154k USD in XMR. The money will be used entirely to pay for the frontend development of Haveno. This is the estimated cost to complete the frontend.

```
Total funding proposed: $154,000 USD.

ETA (period): 4-6 months (TBD).
```

This is based on Haveno's new structure, that involves *Engine*, a CCS-like structure and the *Engine Council*, which will be in charge of managing Engine funds.

The exchange will not be run by a third party, as was originally proposed in the initial CCS[^3], but by a *non-legal entity*.

You can read more about Haveno's structure on their blog[^4].

To share your feedback, ask questions and support this proposal, consult !295[^2].

To stay up to date with the project, join Haveno's Matrix and IRC channels[^5].
