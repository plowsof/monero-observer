MyMonero (for Mobile)[^1] is looking[^2] for tech-savvy wallet users to take part in their iOS app beta test:

> We need your help getting it over the finish line. Looking for tech-savvy MyMonero wallet users willing to take part in our beta test. 

The light-weight Monero wallet has recently added a built-in coin swap feature and the ability to purchase XMR using fiat.

### Notes (before testing)

- back your mnemonic seeds up before installing the beta version
- once you move across to the beta version of the iOS app, there is no way to return to the old version

To be added to list of testers, DM u/tekkzbadger[^3] on Reddit.

The app is available in both the Apple Store[^4] and Google Play Store[^5]. 

MyMonero can also be used in the browser[^6], on Linux, Windows and macOS. Executables can be found in the official repository[^7].
