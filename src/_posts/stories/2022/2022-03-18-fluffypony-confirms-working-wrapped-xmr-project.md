fluffypony[^1] has confirmed[^2] that he is working on a project involving wrapped XMR, DeFi protocols, borrowing and farming:

> [..] Whilst this will definitely come to Tari, Iâ€™ve been working on something more mainstream that will primarily allow for borrowing against wrapped XMR, but will also allow for defi protocols to allow for farming etc.[^3]

Timeline info and other specifications will be shared as soon as they *have some more details nailed down*.

I will update this report and/or post a new one as soon as any related announcements are out.
