hinto-janaiyo[^1] has released v2.0.0[^2] of monero-toolchain[^3], a bash script that downloads Monero-related software:

> I use basically all of these so I made a script so that I could more easily manage monero-related software between multiple computers[^4]

### Downloaded tools

```
Monero GUI
Monero CLI
Feather
MyMonero
XMRig
MoneroOcean
P2Pool
```

The tool is available only for Linux (64-bit) systems.

To get started with monero-toolchain, consult the README.md[^5] in the project's code repository.

It is recommended to review the 239-line bash script code[^6] before usage.

To support the dev and the project, you can donate XMR to the address listed on GH[^7].

hinto-janaiyo has also recently released XMRig-Auto-Build v1.2, a user-friendly interactive bash script that builds the latest XMRig from source, as previously reported[^8].
