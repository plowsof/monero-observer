Rucknium[^1] has shared weekly and monthly visualizations[^2]'[^3] of Monero ring member age distribution since 2014/04:

> I created a visualization of the evolution of the distribution of ring member age over time.[^4]

The researcher proceeds to explain that the kernel density estimate is *a more sophisticated histogram*[^5].

The X axis represents *the natural logarithm of the number of seconds that had elapsed since the referenced output was confirmed in a block*[^6].

Rucknium is working on OSPEAD[^7] research, which aims to fortify Monero against statistical attacks. Recently he has been looking to collect information on nonstandard Monero decoy selection algorithms[^8].

Join *#monero-research-lab* on IRC/Matrix[^9] and read the logs[^10] to view Rucknium's investigation remarks and get involved in the discussion. 

Consult my mid-2021 Monero transaction volume anomaly report[^11] if you want to go deeper.
