emesik[^1] has announced[^2] the release of `monero-python`[^3] v1.0[^4]:

> I'm proud to announce that I've just released the version 1.0 of monero-python, which is a comprehensive Python library for handling Monero

To learn more about the module, consult my previous report[^5] and the project documentation[^6].

We can expect a new CCS proposal soon, according to the dev:

> I'll be probably applying for CCS funding once I gather and assess the effort of the most important future features. 

Meanwhile, to support the development of the `monero-python` open source library, you can donate some XMR to the address listed in the README[^7].
