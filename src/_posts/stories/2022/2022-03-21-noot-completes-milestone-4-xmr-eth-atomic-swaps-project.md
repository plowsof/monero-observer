noot[^1] has completed[^2] the 4th milestone for her XMR-ETH atomic swaps CCS proposal[^3]:

> Hey all, I've completed milestone 4 (end-to-end integration testing), it ended up taking a bit longer than expected as I ended up implementing a websockets server and quite a few subscription methods for easier testing [..]

### Other work

- for milestone 3: the DLEq integration is complete
- for milestone 6: begun research on an adaptor signature version of the protocol for increased privacy and gas savings

Read the full dev report[^2] to view the PRs for this milestone.

Consult my previous reports[^4]'[^5] to learn more about the project.
