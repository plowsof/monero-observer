With *The Monero Moon*[^1] newsletter's future in question, author John Foss[^2] has requested feedback[^3] from the community:

> I've had my new The Monero Moon CCS proposal open for a few weeks now. so I write this post to gain community feedback regarding whether I should continue the newsletter.

> I hope you can check out all the Monero newsletters, think about what content you want to help support the Monero project, and then make your mind up to decide whether you support my proposal or not.

The CCS[^4] for the independent publication was recently completed, after 33 issues were published. One extra issue (#34)[^5] was published last week. 

The new proposal is currently stuck at the *Ideas* stage.

Post your feedback and questions for John's CCS proposal on Gitlab[^6] if you support *The Monero Moon* and want to fund at least 18 more issues.
