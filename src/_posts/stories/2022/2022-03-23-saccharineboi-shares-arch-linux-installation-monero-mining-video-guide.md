saccharineboi[^1] has shared a video[^2] in which they install Arch Linux[^3] and start mining Monero:

> [ASMR] Installing Arch Linux under QEMU/KVM and mining Monero

There is no commentary and the audio consists of background noise and typing sounds. It could be considered *ASMR*, as the author suggests in the title.

The video is using *cool-retro-term*[^4], a terminal emulator which mimics the old cathode display. 

The full step-by-step CLI process is recorded: from partitions and system updates to building from source and XMRig[^5] mining and everything in between.
