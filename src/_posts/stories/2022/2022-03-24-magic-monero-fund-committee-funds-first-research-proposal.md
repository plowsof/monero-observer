*MAGIC Grants*[^1]'s Monero Fund[^2] committee[^3] has voted to support and fund its first ever research proposal.

According to Rucknium[^4], 12K USD will be allocated to ACK-J[^5]'s proposal[^6]:

> The MAGIC Monero Fund committee has voted to support this research project for 12,000 USD equivalent. Good luck![^7]

ACK-J is planning to use this grant to continue the research they started in December 2021:

> [..] to produce a high-quality, deanonymized dataset of stagenet Monero transactions and an empirical analysis of ring signature resiliency to supervised deep learning attacks.[^8]

The researcher is looking to assess the attack surface of ring signatures in a machine and deep learning attack context:

> [..] I would like to assess the privacy protections gained against the aforementioned attacks after increasing the ring size from 11 to 16.

You can learn more about the project, its milestones and budget by reading the complete research proposal on Github[^6].

We can expect an update on April 1st, when ACK-J will share more technical details in a MAGIC update post.

To learn more about the application process, read the *Research-Grant-RFP.md*[^9] document.

Consult my previous reports[^10]'[^11]'[^12] to learn more about MAGIC.
