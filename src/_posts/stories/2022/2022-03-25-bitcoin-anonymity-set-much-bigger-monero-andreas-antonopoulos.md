According to Andreas Antonopoulos[^1], Bitcoin's *anonymity set is much bigger* than Monero's:

> Because Bitcoin is a store of value, it has more liquidity. Because it has more liquidity, more value and broader acceptability and is easier to exchange. It's more useful as a currency and therefore it also means it's used by more people, **which means the anonymity set is much bigger.** (0:16)

This is a rather peculiar statement, since an *anonymity set* intrinsically implies indistinguishability. Thus, it is unclear how one could seriously propose Bitcoin as a valid part of this equation, since BTC is clearly not fungible.

In other words, what is the privacy value of a theoretically *infinte* anonymity set if the entities that comprise the set can be easily distinguishable from each other and tracked by most decently capable adversaries?
