DangerousFreedom1984[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2] looking to finish building Python tools and educational material for checking and explaining the absence of *money leakage* (a.k.a. inflation) in Monero:

> I believe that basically what needs to be done is the creation of Python scripts and educational materials in order to: check the ring signatures, check the amounts involved, check the uniqueness of key images and check the emission curve.

```
Total funding: 43.2 XMR.

ETA: end of August 2022.
```

### Milestones

- M1: MLSAG (ETA: end of May, 14.4 XMR)
- M2: CLSAG (ETA: end of June, 14.4 XMR)
- M3: Seraphis / Optimizations / Functional website delivery (ETA: end of August, 14.4 XMR)

The anonymous Python dev has already been working for 2 months on the *initial scratch* for the Pre-RingCT (v1) era. 

Visit the *Monero Inflation Checker* WiP website[^3] and repository[^4] to have an idea of how the final product will look like.
