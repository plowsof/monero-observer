mj[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2] looking to fund the *SolOptXMR* (Solar Optimal mining of XMR) project. 

The open-source software will be focused on helping miners that want to use excess solar power to mine Monero:

> The goal is to create open-source software that aids people mining Monero with excess solar power in the most profitable way.

```
Total funding: 130 XMR (71 XMR mj + 59 XMR Endor).

ETA: ~7 months (before winter 2022).
```

To complete this project, mj plans on working side by side with Endor[^3], a junior Python dev and Aerospace Engineering student. 

mj has been contributing to Monero for the past 2 years and already has an active CCS proposal that is almost 100% funded[^4]. If funded, the dev is only planning to dedicate 10 hours per week for this project.

More details about his work can be found in his previous proposal[^5]'s progress report[^6] and on Github[^7].

Endor has been moderating a Monero mining room on Matrix[^8] and is planning to publish a small paper or a series of articles to serve as *the ultimate guide to mining*[^9].

### Milestones

- M1: Initial setup (23.667 XMR, ~96 work hours, mostly mj's)
- M2: Profitability calculator (19.667 XMR, 144 work hours, mostly Endor's)
- M3: Measurements (43.33 XMR, 96+144 work hours, mj+Endor)
- M4: Automation (43.33 XMR, 96+144 work hours, mj+Endor)

**Update 22/3/27: add clarification that mj is only planning to work 10 hours/week on this project.** 

**Update 22/4/13: moved to funding[^10].**

**Update 22/4/23: fully funded[^11].**
