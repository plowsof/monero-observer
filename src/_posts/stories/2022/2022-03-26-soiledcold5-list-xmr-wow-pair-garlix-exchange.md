SoiledCold5[^1] has announced[^2] their intention to list a *WOW/XMR* trading pair on the upcoming Garlicoin[^3]-based crypto exchange, Garlix[^4]:

> Since I have some wownero and some friends in the wownero community I will also have an unique pair for Wownero, aka WOW/XMR. The confirmation count for wownero will be low and so will monero.

According to the announcement, users will be allowed to run trading bots on the platform. No other details were specified.
