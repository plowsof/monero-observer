ChangeNOW[^1] has announced[^2] the addition of Monero to its *NOW*[^3] crypto wallet:

> We're excited to announce that NOW Wallet – a non-custodial wallet that doesn’t collect any personal data – supports @Monero now!

According to their ToS[^4], users can be KYC'd during the exchange process:

> NOW Wallet’s third-party partner ChangeNOW reserve the right to verify User’s identity during the Exchange processes, according to their policy

The so-called *non-custodial* wallet doesn't seem to be open source, as the source code for NOW cannot be presently found on their Github[^5].

*Note: this is a centralized service and it can not respect your privacy. KYC measures will be enforced on its users. Use alternative Atomic Swaps/DEX/P2P exchanges/wallets instead, if possible.*
