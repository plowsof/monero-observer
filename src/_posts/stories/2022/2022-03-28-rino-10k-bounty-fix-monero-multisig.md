The RINO[^1] team has put out[^2] a $10,000 bounty towards fixing Monero's multisignature wallet code[^3]:

> The bounty, paid in XMR, will go towards the Monero General Fund. We will pay on the release of the next hardfork version, if it includes relevant multisig fixes (PRs 7877, 8149, 8220, and any directly related PRs).

To learn more about RINO, read my previous report[^4].
