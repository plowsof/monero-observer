A Monero Observer **Mini RSS** feed[^1] is now available on the RSS[^2] page. 

The mini feed only fetches the most recent 50 items in the main *feed.xml* and it should load faster than all the other feeds.

The idea was suggested by a loyal reader, thank you!

Let me know if it's helpful: feedback and suggestions are always welcome @ [/about](/about).
