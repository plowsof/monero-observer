anon_[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2] looking to build *Shadowcart*, an XMR *instant online store*:

> Shadowcart aims to make it easy to convert any website into an online store by simply adding an html button to it.

```
Total funding: 20 XMR.

ETA: ~2 months.
```

The open-source software (GNU GPLv3) will be written in Go and aims to combine the functionality of a shopping cart and a pay server into one program. 

A test instance is available on Neocities[^3]. The source code is available on Sourcehut[^4].

### Milestones

- M1: Fully functional (15 XMR)
- M2: Security and Load Testing (5 XMR)

To read the full proposal, share your feedback, ask questions and support this CCS, consult !303[^2].

**Update: anon_ decided to close the proposal and continue working on the project without funding it through the CCS.**
