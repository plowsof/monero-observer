Monero contributor mjxmr[^1] has posted his March 2022 dev report[^2] for community review:

> There were some turbulence at the end of February and I wasn't sure if I should continue working, since my proposal wasn't ready for funding until as late as on the 17th of March. In my proposal I promised I'd start from 1st March, and so I did, nevertheless.

The report addresses various topics: *tsqsim*[^3], the results of the IDE poll[^4], his new CCS[^5] proposal (with Endor), an upcoming proposal about sending Monero transactions through a hard to detect mesh radio, new branches, PRs and issues, as well as some *(anti)-social affairs*.  

To better understand mjxmr's CCS-related work on Monero, you can read john_r365[^6]'s *Layman's Guide*[^7].
