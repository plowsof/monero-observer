*P2Pool* version 1.9[^1] has been released and it fixes a critical bug:

> **Fixed block template generation bug:** a node could mine a share that didn't pass validation on other nodes resulting in all other nodes banning it. Nodes with high hashrate are the most affected because they mine a lot of shares.

### Other changes

  * Fixed several bugs that can happen when system time changes
  * Improved `p2pool.cache` efficiency
  * `status` command shows sidechain name now (default, mini or custom ID)

## Wallets with P2Pool support

  * Official Monero CLI and GUI v0.17.2.3 and newer
  * Monerujo v2.1.0 "Vertant" and newer
  * Cake Wallet v4.2.7 and newer
  * Monero.com by Cake Wallet
  * Feather Wallet v1.0.0 and newer
  * MyMonero


Before using the software, you should verify the SHA256 sums with SChernykh[^2]'s GPG key[^3].

The README[^4] has valuable information about features, defaults, how pool shares work, build instructions and a short mining guide.

If you need assistance, you can read the FAQ[^5] and reach out to other P2Pool miners on irc[^6].
