Haveno[^1]'s revised CCS[^2] proposal has been finally moved to the funding stage, after receiving lots of mixed feedback from the Monero community:

> Thanks, everyone for your engagement here, both for and against. I think the whole gamut of outcomes are possible, both in the success of Haveno itself and in the success/dis/function of the Council. **Ultimately, we've decided to move forward.** (luigi1111[^3]) 

```
181 contributors raised ~760 XMR (100%+)
```

To support this proposal, you can donate some XMR to the address listed on its Gitlab Funding Required[^4] page or by sending from your preferred Monero wallet to *fund.haveno.exchange*[^5] via OpenAlias. 

Read Haveno's announcement[^6] for more funding information.

To learn more about the proposal and Haveno's new structure, consult my previous report[^7].

**Update: fully funded[^8].**
