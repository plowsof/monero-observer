willk[^1] has submitted a rather ambiguous CCS proposal[^2] looking to build *a Monero ecological platform*:

> Let more people use XMR, telegram push, small transactions done in seconds, docker private deployment, provide free API service [..] Build a set of out-of-the-box programs so that more people can use XMR [..] 

```
Total funding: TBD (unclear).

ETA: ~3 months.
```

To read the full proposal, share your feedback, ask questions and support this CCS, consult !300[^2].

*I will update the report if/when more specific information is available.*

**Update: proposal closed; new CCS proposal was submitted[^3].**
