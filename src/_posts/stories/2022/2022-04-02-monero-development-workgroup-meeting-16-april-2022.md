The next *Monero Development Workgroup* meeting is scheduled[^1] to take place on Saturday, 16 April 2022 at 17:00 UTC.

The meeting should take place on IRC-Libera/Matrix[^2] in the #monero-dev channels.

Note that although there is no set agenda, the status of the current hard fork will probably be the focus of this meeting. Provided the remaining PRs are reviewed by then, hopefully the HF date can be set.

This meeting's chairperson will probably be *ErCiccione*[^3].
