m0n3r0d1c3[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2] looking to deploy a *Monero Dice* casino:

> Hello! I'm M0n3r0D1c3, and I've created casino for Monero. Yup already created, the code is written and it works pretty well. Hence - it was even deployed once[^3] but died because of lack of proper marketing and funding.

```
Total funding: 1.08 XMR.

ETA: ~a few days (to deploy, already coded).
```

The funds will be used to cover the VPS and domain name registration costs.

### Features

- Provably fair bets
- No minimum bet, withdrawal and deposit amounts
- Option to play as the house (get 1% edge)
[..]

### Milestones

- M1: Deployment (1.08 XMR)
