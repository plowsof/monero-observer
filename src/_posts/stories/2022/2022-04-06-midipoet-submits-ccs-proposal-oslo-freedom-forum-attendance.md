midipoet[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2] looking to fund his attendance to the 2022 *Oslo Freedom Forum*[^3] (May 23-25):

> [..] I would like to attend the 2022 Oslo Freedom Forum - May 23-25 2022 in Oslo - and more specifically like to attend the Financial Freedom Track.

```
Total funding: 8.5 XMR.

ETA: July 1st (deadline).
```

### Milestones

- M1: Proposal funded (5 XMR)
- M2: Report submitted (3.5 XMR)

If funded, this would cover costs for flights, hotels and food. Also part of the proposal are the printing and handing out of Monero flyers (at the event) and plans for writing a report and partaking in an *Exit Strategy*[^4] podcast.

midipoet has been involved with the *Monero Policy Working Group*[^5] and is part of the organizing team for *MoneroKon 2022*[^6]. 

To read the full proposal, share your feedback, ask questions and support this CCS, consult !306[^2].
