CryptoGrampy[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2] looking to code *HotShop*, an *ephemeral* Point of Sale web app for Monero:

> You'll be able to set this up at a garage sale, coffee shop, with your friends, etc and generate fresh/unused payment addresses displayed as QR codes. 

> The tech stack will be something like: Monero-Javascript, Vue3, and Typescript.

```
Total funding: 18 XMR.

ETA: 4-8 months.
```

### Milestones

- M1: Create and publish payment code, perform basic payment generation and verification on deployed webapp (0 XMR)
- M2: Create and publish draft Point of Sale user interface for feedback (8 XMR)
- M3: Create finalized Point of Sale interface, create install and deployment instructions, publish freely available version (10 XMR)

The app will not require a spend key, only the primary and view keys (on the client side) and a remote Monero node address. 

Tor support is currently on a *potential reach ideas* list.
