gnuteardrops[^1] has reached an impressive *Monero.Graphics*[^2] milestone yesterday after publishing the 100th[^3] design titled *Monero encrypt ideas*:

> Encrypt your mind.

The artist has been working 100% *pro bono publico* for the past ~7 months, since September 2021.

From wallpapers and stickers to cards and comics, all the graphics are licensed *CC BY-SA 4.0*[^4] and that means anyone can copy, redistribute, remix and transform them for any purpose, even commercially:

> Hopefully my work inspires others to contribute something of value to the Monero community. When people use my work, only then I am happy. (gnuteardrops)

gnuteardrops has also designed the graphics for *MoneroKon 2022*[^5] (*Konferenco Lisbon 2022* logo and illustration), *Monero Observer* (*Blitz*[^6] covers) and for other projects in the Monero community for free.

You can send your feedback and ideas to gnuteardrops via email[^7] or matrix[^8] and potentially donate some XMR[^1] to stimulate their generous work for our community.
