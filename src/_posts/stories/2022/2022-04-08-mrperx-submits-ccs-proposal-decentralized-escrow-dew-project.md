mrperx[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2] looking to create *Dew*, a decentralized general escrow desktop application:

> I propose to create a Desktop Application with Electron using Monero, libp2p and Tor to create a decentralized escrow service anybody can use with maximum privacy. The escrow is based on multisig and works with 2-of-3 signatures. The application is similar to Bisq but instead of an exchange, this is a general escrow.

```
Total funding: 250 XMR.

ETA: TBD.
```

### Milestones

- M1: Desktop app with libp2p chat messaging over tor (50 XMR)
- M2: Monero wallet support, Multisig (50 XMR)
- M3: Decentralied Escrow Agent Registry (50 XMR)
- M4: UI and UX (50 XMR)
- M5: Desktop app for Linux, Windows and MacOS (50 XMR)
