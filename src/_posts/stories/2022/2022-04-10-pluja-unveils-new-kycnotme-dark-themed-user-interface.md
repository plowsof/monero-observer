pluja[^1] has unveiled[^2] a new and improved dark themed user interface[^3] for *KYC? Not me!*[^4], looking for feedback from the Monero community:

> Hey everyone. Lately I've been working on a new UI for KYCNOT.me [..] I want to get some feedback before switching this UI to the main site. Note that it may still contain some bugs!

### Changes

    Revamped dark-themed UI
    You can now apply filters
    Improved service info page
    Improved overall performance
    Show status of the service
    Improved automated checks

The source code for the project is available on Codeberg[^5]. The new UI code can be accessed on the `ui-redesign` branch[^6].

The project maintainer has previously rewritten[^7] the website and added new functionality in September 2021.

pluja has also created *ISeeYour.cash*[^8] and attempted to fund the *Moneroj.info*[^9] project throught Monero's CCS, but decided against it[^10] in the end.
