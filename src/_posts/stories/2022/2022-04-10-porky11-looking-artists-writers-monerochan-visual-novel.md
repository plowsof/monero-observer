porky11[^1] is looking[^2] for artists and writers to contribute to Monerochan visual novel prototype[^3]:

```
You're a boy and live in a small village with your parents. [..] 
You always wanted to go to the nearby city. 
It seems like a magical place to you, where you don't need to work.
```

> I still need some artist(s), and writer(s) would also be nice.

For more information consult the Gitlab repository[^4] and join the Discord[^5] channel.
