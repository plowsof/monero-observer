eversinc33[^1] has created an experimental client implementation for the Monero wallet RPC server in Nim[^2]:

> If there are any Nim-programmers among us here, I just finished creating a library for interfacing with Monero wallets via RPC: https://github.com/eversinc33/nim-monero-rpc-client[^3]

Consult the repository README.md[^4] for more details. 

Note that not all methods have been intensively tested yet, so it is recommended to test the code on stagenet before using any of the bindings.
