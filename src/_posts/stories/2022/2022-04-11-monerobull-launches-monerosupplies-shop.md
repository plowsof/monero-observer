monerobull[^1] has announced[^2] the launch of monerosupplies.com[^3] shop:

> This site will not only make ordering stickers way simpler but also improve privacy since personal data won't be exchanged over third parties like reddit, discord or telegram anymore.

Previously, monerobull has been supplying the community with cheap Monero stickers in the weekly *Friday Market Threads*[^4].

monerobull is currently working with gnuteardrops[^5] from Monero.Graphics[^6] to add more designs to their shop (*Monero Stop Sticker*[^7]).
