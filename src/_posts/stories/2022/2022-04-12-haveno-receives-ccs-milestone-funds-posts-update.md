Haveno[^1] has posted a community update[^2] after receiving funds from their first CCS[^3] proposal milestone (151 XMR):

> We received the first milestone of our CCS (151 XMR). The way we use these funds will be tracked on a dedicated file on the haveno-meta repository: monero-ccs.md[^4].

> We also already created the repository that will host the user interface[^5]

To interact with the community, join the Haveno dev room on Matrix/IRC[^6].

To learn more about the proposal, consult my previous report[^7].
