fatalglory[^1] has created *monerod-proxy*[^2], a small Golang[^3] app (HTTP proxy server) that should enable more merchants to *start accepting XMR for payments with lower overhead costs to get started*:

> This basic version is useful for individual merchants who are just looking to get cheap, reliable access to data from monerod to power their XMR checkout process.[^4]

The dev has been using the open source software in production and it should work with both Monero CLI wallet[^5] and Cake Wallet[^6].

To get started and learn about the features, consult the README[^7].

Note that the software might still have bugs. Inspect the source code before usage, if possible.
