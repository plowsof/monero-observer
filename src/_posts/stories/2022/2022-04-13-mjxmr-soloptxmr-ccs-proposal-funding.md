mj[^1]'s CCS[^2] proposal to create the *SolOptXMR* (Solar Optimal mining of XMR) software, with the help of Endor[^3], is now ready for funding:


```
52 contributors raised 110.55 of 110.55 XMR (100%)
```

To support this proposal, you can donate some XMR to the address listed on its Gitlab *Funding Required*[^4] page.

To learn more about the project, consult my previous report[^5].
