Haveno[^1] has adopted the *Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct* version 2.1[^2], after erciccione[^3]'s recent commit[^4] to the official repository:

> We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation. [..]

The Contributor Covenant was created by Coraline Ada Ehmke[^5], an open source dev, advocate, and LGBT activist.

Althought this has already been adopted by a lot of open-source projects since 2014, both the CoC and its creator have been surrounded by controversy[^6]'[^7]'[^8]'[^9]. 

The enforcement of a *political document*[^10] in *FLOSS* projects has raised concerns over exposing the open source world to anti-meritocracy proponents and the inherent conflict with the status quo, *code is law*, mantra:

> This seems antithetical to the often-needed brutal honesty that promotes the best code. I don't want to be saddled with inferior code because someone's feelings might have been hurt. The priority should be towards "excellence in code" over "excellence in politics". (ReinsBrain)[^11]

It will be interesting to see when and how exactly this will be enforced with Haveno and how the Monero community will react.
