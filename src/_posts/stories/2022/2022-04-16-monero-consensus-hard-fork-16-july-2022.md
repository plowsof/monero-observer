Monero is set to hard fork on July 16th 2022 at block 2668888[^1], after the community has reached consensus in today's *Monero Development Workgroup* meeting[^2].

### Dates

```
May 16 - Branch with HF-required PRs
Soon after May 16 - Testnet hard fork
June 16 - 0.18 release
July 16 - Mainnet hard fork
```

To learn more about the v15 hard fork, consult the associated *checklist*[^3] and blog post[^4] and my previous report[^5].

Note that this network upgrade is not the Seraphis/Jamtis HF[^6], which is still *years* away.
