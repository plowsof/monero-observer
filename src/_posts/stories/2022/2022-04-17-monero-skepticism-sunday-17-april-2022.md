The weekly Monero *Skepticism Sunday* thread[^1] on Reddit is now open. 

The rules are pretty simple:

- post your concerns about Monero in reply to the main post
- if you can address a concern, reply to that specific post
- upvote comments that have the most valid criticism and/or posts that have no genuine answers/solutions to them

Ideally the posts that mention bigger problems should get the most karma.

*Skepticism Sunday* has become a Monero tradition:

> I think most of us here at r/Monero currently care about having the best cypherpunk cryptocurrency as we realize that is really where cryptocurrencies derive their value/utility. In order for us to really ensure we keep those ideals, we should always look at our tech critically.[^2] [Vespco[^3]]
