The community is celebrating Monero's 8th birthday today with great news from the XMR bulls that have just registered their 7th consecutive weekly victory[^1], pushing the cryptocurrency to an 110-day high[^2].

The *Monerun*[^3] event is also taking place today and pretty much everyone is looking forward to the next hard fork, that was recently announced[^4].

With all the craziness that is happening in the world right now, can Monero finally reemerge from the depths of the cypherpunk world to help liberate *we the people*?

Perhaps. Certainly we can all help: join us[^5]'[^6]. 

**Happy Monero birthday, fellow *anon!***
