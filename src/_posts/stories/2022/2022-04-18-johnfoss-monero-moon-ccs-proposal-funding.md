John Foss[^1]'s CCS[^2] proposal to publish the next 18 issues of *The Monero Moon*[^3] newsletter (#34-#51) is now ready for funding:


```
28 contributors raised 36 of 36 XMR (100%)
```

To support this proposal, you can donate some XMR to the address listed on its Gitlab *Funding Required*[^4] page.
