reemuru[^1]'s *This Year in Monero - 2022* post[^2] was recently merged[^3] by binaryFate[^4] and is now live on the official Getmonero.org blog[^5]:

> As a way to celebrate and show the growth that has happened for Monero across the past year on this, the 8th anniversary of the Monero project, I wanted to take a snapshot of statistics and social media posts to highlight this growth.

Several topics are covered, including transactions, blockchain growth, emissions, fees, mining, social metrics, CCS campaigns and major network upgrades.

The article has been approved after being reviewed by erciccione[^6] and sethforprivacy[^7].

The blog post was apparently *sponsored*[^8] by sethforprivacy.
