Monero (XMR/USDT) has achieved a new 110-day high today after touching 253, essentially wiping all 2022 losses.

Provided the current uptrend continues, it is bound to return XMR back to the 260-300 zone soon, which was heavily traded back in October-November of last year.

If nothing else, today's *Monerun*[^1] event can be considered a success, at least in terms of price action.

The bulls are currently trying to establish a stable support above 250. Read the most recent TA report[^2] to learn more about last week's action and potential scenarios for next week.
