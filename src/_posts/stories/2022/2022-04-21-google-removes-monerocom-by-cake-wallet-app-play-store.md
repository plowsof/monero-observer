Google has removed the *Monero.com by Cake Wallet* app[^1] from their *Play Store*, according to *Cake Labs*[^2]:

> Google has COMPLETELY removed our Monero.com app from @GooglePlay, claiming we are impersonating Freewallet. This is absolutely false. [..]

> We have submitted several appeals to Google [..]

According to Google, the app was suspended for not *adhering to Google Play Developer Program Policies*.

If *ArticMine*[^3] is correct, *Cake Labs* should expect a trademark fight with *Freewallet*:

> I suspect an aggressive move by Freewallet here is behind this, such as making allegations of trademark infringement to Google. I doubt that Google made this move on their own.[^4]

Note that *Freewallet* is currently on the r/Monero *Avoid* list[^5].

The delisting could be temporary, but until this issue is resolved, users can still download and use the Android .APK from Github[^6].

To learn more about Cake's Monero-only wallet, consult my previous report[^7].

**Update: the app is back in the Play Store[^8].**
