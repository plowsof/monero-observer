hegjon[^1] has shared a short demo video[^2] for the *Cipo*[^3] software, in which they pay with XMR for electricity:

> Cipo makes it easy to let users pay for electricity for their camper-van, electric cars, boat, caravan and other high load cases. Monero is the only platform for payment at the moment, other crypto currencies might be supported in the future.

Cipo currently supports the *Shelly Pro 4PM*[^4] relay.

> [..] first we locate and scan the QR code and pay the amount [..] and then the software will detect the payment [..] amount is used up and then it will turn itself on/off again .. (0:30)

To learn more about the software and its configuration options, consult the Github repository[^3].
