binarybaron[^1] has shared a mainnet demo[^2] for their XMR-BTC atomic swap desktop GUI prototype[^3]:

> Just wanted to post an update on the progress of the development of the first GUI for XMR<>BTC Atomic Swaps. 

> The prototype GUI we wanted to develop can now be used to exchange coins on the testnet and theoretically (as shown in the video) also on mainnet.

To learn more about the project, consult the associated CCS proposal[^4] and my previous report[^5].
