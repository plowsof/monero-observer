Haveno[^1] has published the list[^2] of crypto assets that will be available at launch:

```
Bitcoin (BTC)
Ether (ETH)
BitcoinCash (BCH)
Litecoin (LTC)
Zcash (ZEC)
```

The inclusion of Zcash has been met with a heavy dose of skepticism and has angered many[^3]'[^4] in the Monero community, while other voices suggested an alternative perspective[^5]'[^6] on the hot topic.

The DEX also plans[^7] to support other crypto and fiat currencies in the future, as soon as the platform is *solid enough*: 

```
Crypto:

Dogecoin (DOGE) 	
Siafund (SF) 	
Namecoin (NMC) 	
Townforge (TFG) 	

Fiat: 

Brazilian Real (BRL)
Australian Dollar (AUD)
Czech Koruna (CZK)
Canadian dollar (CAD)
Indian Rupee (INR)
Swiss Franc (CHF)
```

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated if/when new information is available.*

**Update 22/4/29: Haveno drops Zcash plans, denies all financial ties in blog announcement[^8].**

**Update 22/5/3: listing process available[^9].**
