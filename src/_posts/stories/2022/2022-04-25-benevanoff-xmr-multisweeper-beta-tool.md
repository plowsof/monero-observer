benevanoff[^1] has announced[^2] the beta release for his *XMR-Multisweeper*[^3] CLI tool:

> Basically if you have a bunch of old seeds this program can sync them all at once with multithreading and then sweeps everything to a single address so you donâ€™t have to sync, wait, and then sweep every wallet individually.

The tool essentially consolidates several wallets into one by scanning the Monero blockchain and sweeping all found decryptable owned transaction outputs to a single wallet.

To learn more about the tool and read the build and usage instructions, consult the code repository[^3].
