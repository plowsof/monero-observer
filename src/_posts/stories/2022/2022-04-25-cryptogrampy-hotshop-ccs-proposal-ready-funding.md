CryptoGrampy[^1]'s CCS proposal[^2] to code *HotShop*, an *ephemeral* Point of Sale web app for Monero is now ready for funding[^3]:

```
28 contributors raised 18 of 18 XMR (100%)
```

To support this proposal, you can donate some XMR to the address listed on its Gitlab *Funding Required*[^3] page.

To learn more about the project, consult my previous report[^4].

**Update: fully funded.**
