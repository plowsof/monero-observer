selsta[^1]'s CCS proposal[^2] to continue working part-time on Monero development for 3 more months, until the end of July is now ready for funding[^3]:

```
11 contributors raised ~0.8 of 75 XMR (so far)
```

To support this proposal, you can donate some XMR to the address listed on its Gitlab *Funding Required*[^3] page.

To learn more about the project, consult my previous report[^4].
