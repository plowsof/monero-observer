kayabaNerve[^1] has discovered a security vulnerability in the *monero-python*[^2] module and j-berman[^3] helped emesik[^4], the project maintainer, to quickly push out the v1.0.2[^5] release that patches it:

> If anyone is using my monero Python module for output recognition, please **upgrade immediately** to version 1.0.2. (emesik)[^6]

According to emesik, a malicious user could prepare a forged transaction and push an arbitrary payment amount and the vulnerable code in earlier versions (<1.0.2) would blindly trust this operation.

Even though users that don't use the module for transaction scanning and to identify outputs using the view key are not affected, they should still upgrade to the newest version.

To learn more about the module, consult the project documentation[^7].

To support the development of the `monero-python` open source library, you can donate some XMR to the address listed in the README[^8].
