cTemplar is shutting down on May 26th 2022, according to their announcement[^1].

Until further notice, *DNMX* will be the new primary email service provider for Monero Observer. Additional (backup) emails might be added in the future.

## Changes

- new main contact email address: escapethe3ra **at** dnmx **dot** org
- updated GPG key with the new email, revoked the old one

Feel free to verify the *[/contact-signed.txt](/contact-signed.txt)* file with my [GPG key](/3RA_pubkey.asc). Consult the [/about](/about#signature) page for more information.

You can follow my [step by step guide](/gpg-cleartext-signatures) if you need help verifying my accounts.

*Note that [XMPP](/about#xmpp-omemo) still remains the preferred contact method. If you use email, try to manually encrypt your message if at all possible.*

*PS: if looking for an ESP, consult my new [List of email service providers for anons](/list-anon-email-service-providers) and let me know if that's helpful.*

**-3RA**
