Waves.Exchange[^1] Legal team has replied to Monero Observer inquiries related to their previously reported[^2] plans to delist Monero:

> Dear -3RA (Monero.Observer), **The anonymity of Monero coin puts us at security risk.** According to ToU, we have the right at any time and in our sole discretion to discontinue any listed tokens in case we suspect a security risk or due to other reasons at our discretion.

Coins not withdrawn before May 8th 2022 are risking forfeiture. To learn more about this story, consult my previous report[^2]. 

*Note: despite Wave's prompt reply (within 7 days), this MO report was delayed mainly due to cTemplar access issues and the fact that emails are sometimes buried deep in the spam folder. This story will be updated if/when new information is available.*
