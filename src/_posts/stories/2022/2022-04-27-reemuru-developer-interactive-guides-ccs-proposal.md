reemuru[^1] has submitted a CCS proposal[^2] to create interactive guides for Monero developers:

> This proposal is not just for the development itself but for the hosting of the interactive environment with JupyterHub. This facilitates coding and learning with ZERO setup.

```
Total funding: 60 XMR.

ETA: end of October 2022 (6 months @ 12.5hr/wk).
```

### Tasks overview

- Maintain JupyterHub infrastructure and expand as required
- Bug fixes and new tutorials

A proof-of-concept is available at *xmr-dev-guides*[^3]'[^4]. ~~Note that a GitHub account is necessary for OAuth.~~

reemuru has contributed 10 commits to `monero-project`[^5]'[^6]'[^7] so far, since last year.

To share your feedback, ask questions and support this proposal, consult !316[^2].

**Update 22/4/28: Github OAuth removed[^8], but registration is currently invite-only and users will have to request accounts via issues on Github or send a message on IRC[^9].**

**Update 22/4/30: CCS closed/canceled (change of plans)[^10].**
