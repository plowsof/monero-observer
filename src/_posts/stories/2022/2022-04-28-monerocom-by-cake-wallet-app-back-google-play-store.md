The *Monero.com by Cake Wallet* mobile app[^1] is back on the *Play Store*[^2], a week after being removed[^3] by Google, according to a *Cake Labs*[^4] announcement[^5]:

> We're pleased that Monero.com by Cake Wallet is now available again on Google Play!

The app is also available for download from Apple's *App Store*[^6] and as an Android .APK from Github[^7]. All download links are available on the *Monero.com*[^8] website. 

To learn more about Cake's Monero-only wallet, consult my previous report[^9].
