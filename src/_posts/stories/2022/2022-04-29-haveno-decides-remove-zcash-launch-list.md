Haveno[^1] have announced[^2] their decision to remove Zcash (ZEC) from the list of currencies[^3] that will be supported at launch, after receiving heavy criticism from the Monero community[^4]:

> We decided to not include Zcash in the list of the currencies that will be supported at launch. We donâ€™t consider it a priority and we think we have already consumed enough resources on this issue.

The Haveno Core Team (HCT) has also strongly rejected all allegations that payments were received to list ZEC, as *baseless accusations*:

> The Haveno Core Team does not request or accept listing fees. We reject these claims entirely.

The Monero community is currently discussing Haveno's statement on Reddit[^5].

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated if/when new information is available.*
