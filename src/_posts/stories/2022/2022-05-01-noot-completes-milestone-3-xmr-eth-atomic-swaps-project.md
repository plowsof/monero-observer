noot[^1] has completed[^2] the 3rd milestone for her XMR-ETH atomic swaps CCS proposal[^3]:

> Hello again, I've completed milestone 3 (DLEq integration). I ended up going the route of creating C bindings for kayabaNerve's DLEq library [..]

### Associated PRs

- #112[^4]: migrates the codebase to use the CGO DLEq bindings
- #67[^5]: older PR that migrates the codebase to the DLEq version of the protocol

Note that the 4th milestone was completed before this one, as previously reported[^6].

Read the full dev report[^2] for more details, including progress of other milestones.

Consult my previous reports[^7]'[^8] to learn more about the project.
