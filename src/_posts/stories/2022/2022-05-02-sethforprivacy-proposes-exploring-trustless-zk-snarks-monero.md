Sethforprivacy[^1] has opened a new *MRL meta* issue (#100[^2]) *to further explore and catalogue resources on trustless zk-SNARKs in Monero w/o Orchard code*[^3], citing known limitations[^4] of ring signatures:

> The goal of this meta issue is to build a go-to place for links, information, and opportunities for building trustless zk-SNARKs as a potential future protocol building-block for Monero.

> I will write up a blog post further outlining in laymen's terms why exploring zk-SNARKs as a replacement for ring-signatures (and likely confidential amounts) is an interesting and worthwhile topic to explore [..]

According to Sethforprivacy, Amir Taaki[^5] of Dark.fi[^6] has offered to help Monero developers get up to speed on implementing zk-SNARKs (*Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge*[^7]) in Monero's payment protocol. 



Monero devs selsta[^8] and hyc[^9] have both shared conservative comments about this proposal on Matrix:

> it's stupid to plan it now. assuming we deploy seraphis, it will be at least several months of operational experience before we know what shortcomings we want to fix. (hyc)[^10]

> This seems 1-2 years too early [..] anyway if someone is interested (and they have the necessary skills) they can comment on the issue (selsta)[^11]

To learn more about the proposed efforts, open research questions, access reference links and submit feedback, consult MRL meta issue #100[^2].

*This is an ongoing story and will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update 22/5/3: removed reference to Orchard thread[^12].**
