Haveno[^1] has invited[^2] the Monero community to suggest crypto and fiat assets to be paired with XMR on the platform:

> What assets would you like to see supported on #Haveno?

> Input from the community is welcome and highly kept in considered during the decision process. We invite to maintain high quality conversation and refrain from shilling/trolling. The latter would seriously impact the chances of listing the project proposed.

Each submission should go through 4 stages: 

- *Proposed* (pending format review)
- *Review stage* (pending community feedback)
- *PR needed* (accepted, pending pull request)
- *Closed* (accepted/rejected)

Haveno is currently set to launch with support for BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, USD, EUR and GBP, according to their *FAQ*[^3] page.

### Proposed (open, to date)

```
Crypto:

ZEC (Zcash, shielded only)
DOT (Polkadot)
WOW (Wownero)
XHV (Haven)
XST (Stealth)
XEQ (Equilibria)
xUSD
DAI
USDC

Fiat:

BRL
INR
```

To read the full listing terms and process, refer to the repository *README*[^4] file. To propose a new asset, follow the *Issue Template*[^5].
