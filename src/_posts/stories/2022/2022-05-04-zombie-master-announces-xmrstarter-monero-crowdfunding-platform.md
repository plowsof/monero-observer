Zombie Master[^1] has announced *Xmrstarter*[^2], a hosted crowdfunding platform for Monero:

> for people interested in an user-friendly, non-custodial crowdfunding site for monero [..][^3]

Currently there is only one active funding campaign on the website, to release the source code of the Xmrstarter project as FOSS, with a 99 XMR target[^4]. 

Note that the project is currently in a testing stage and there is a listing fee of 0.005 XMR (~$1) that was introduced *to fight spam*, according to Zombie Master.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated when new information is available.*

**Update 22/5/5: plowsof clarified that their xmr-wishlist-aaS is not connected to this project, removed reference.**

**Update 22/5/7: Zombie Master stated that *plowsof was initially affiliated with the project*, but *is no longer affiliated with xmrstarter*[^5].**
