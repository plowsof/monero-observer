AnonimaUzanto[^1] has created *Python Monero Database Reader*[^2], an utility that is *entirely independent* of core Monero code and which allows reading directly from the Monero database using only Python:

> This will allow independent validation of the byte data available to any interested party.

Note that the MIT-licensed code is *highly experimental*, having been tested only under Linux using a pruned database. To report a vulnerability, read the SECURITY[^3] file.

For installation instructions, project features and roadmap, consult the repository README[^4] file.
