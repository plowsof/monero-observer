*Mallorca Blockchain Days*[^1] conference is currently looking[^2] for an EU-based Monero speaker for the upcoming July 14-17 event[^3] in Palma, Mallorca (Spain), according to Justin Ehrenhofer[^4]:

> The Mallorca Blockchain Days conference is looking for a charismatic and knowledgeable speaker about Monero to present. [..] The conference seems to consist primarily of Bitcoin supporters who are also pro-privacy and open to learning more about Monero.

The conference can cover accommodation and *MAGIC Grants*[^5]/the *MAGIC Monero Fund*[^6] can cover flight costs.

Sethforprivacy[^7] and Justin can help with the presentation.

Note that the speech will be recorded. The conference agenda and side events are available on their website[^3].
