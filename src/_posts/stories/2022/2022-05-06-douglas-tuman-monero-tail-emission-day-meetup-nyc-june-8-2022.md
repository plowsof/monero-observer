Douglas Tuman[^1] is looking[^2] to host a *Monero Tail Emission Day Meetup*[^3] event in New York City on June 8th, 2022:

> Come celebrate the end of Moneroâ€™s nominal supply and the beginning of tail emission! [..] An historic event. Consider hosting one in your city too!

The location will be announced soon, according to Douglas:

> We will find a location that will allow us all to buy drinks/food with Monero. [..] in Manhattan, Brooklyn, or Queens [..]

To learn more about the Monero tail emission era, consult my previous report[^4].
