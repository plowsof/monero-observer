Monero contributor mjxmr[^1] has posted his April-May 2022 dev report[^2] for community review:

> We finally have some new Devs on board. Welcome! As you can imagine, it takes time for each other to learn the work culture, like it took me when I on-boarded and The Old Cr3w was patiently pointing me to the right direction, spending their time on this act. 

The report addresses various topics: SolOptXMR[^3], Morero Core libwallet tests[^4], MRL work[^5], new branches, PRs and issues.  

To better understand mjxmr's CCS-related work on Monero, you can read john_r365[^6]'s *Layman's Guide*[^7] and consult the associated CCS proposal[^8].
