Haveno[^1] is looking for Java developers to help with open issues[^2], according to their May 2022 progress update blog post[^3]:

> If you are a Java developer, we need your help. Take a look at the open issues. Those labelled Pn (P1, P2, P3, P4. Where P1 is the top priority and P4 the lowest) are ready to be resolved.

Haveno UI progress can be tracked in the *haveno-ui*[^4] dedicated repository and on the project board[^5].

A new *TypeScript library for programmatically interacting with Haveno* is now available in the *haveno-ts*[^6] repo. 

The Haveno TypeScript interface should be useful both for interactions between the UI and the Haveno core software and for external project integrations.

Read the full update on the Haveno blog section[^3].

Haveno has also invited the Monero community to propose crypto and fiat assets to be paired with XMR on the platform, as previously reported[^7].
