xmrvsbeast[^1] has proposed[^2] a 5 XMR bounty, that would go to anyone who can fix or rework the bot[^3] and make the bounties.monero.social[^4] site fully functional again:

> Monero bounties (https://bounties.monero.social/) is an amazing and unique resource but sadly it is not working presently due to issues with the payment bot, and others possibly. [..] Once the site is working this request will be posted there and funded. 

The bounties bot has been broken for about 2 months, as previously reported[^5].

plowsof[^6] has offered[^7] to rewrite the bot from scratch, in Python.

*This is an ongoing story and the report will be updated if/when new information is available.*

---

**Update: *Low_Application_7086* has created a C# implementation which improves upon the existing Monero bounties Fider bot code[^8].**
