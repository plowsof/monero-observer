In this Monero Talk episode[^1]'[^2], Douglas Tuman interviews Christopher Gronski[^3] on his theory of State vs Federal Citizenship and his love for Monero:

> The key to freedom is responsibility. [..] I think that where the world is now is they are hating tyranny but they're not embracing 'I wanna be responsible for myself' first. People still are looking for permission [..] and certainly looking to their government for help, still.

Several topics are covered in this interview, such as: swapping from federal to state citizenship, not filing income tax returns, centralization, Monero, privacy and freedom.
