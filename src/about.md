description: About Monero Observer and how you can contribute to the project.
---

Hi. I am **escapethe3RA**, the maintainer of **Monero Observer**. This is my humble effort to contribute something of value to the Monero community and also give the outside world a chance to learn about Monero.

While it is virtually impossible to report on every story out there as it happens, I will do my best and use the limited time that I can spare to post consistently. 

## Signature

All my contact details are digitally signed with my public key:

- [/contact-signed.txt](/contact-signed.txt) (signed contact details)
- [/3RA_pubkey.asc](/3RA_pubkey.asc) (my public key) ([changed address](/monero-observer-announcement-ctemplar-shutting-down-switching-dnmx))

You can follow my [step by step guide](/gpg-cleartext-signatures) if you need help verifying my accounts.

## XMPP (OMEMO)

XMPP is the preferred communication method. Read related [meta post](/xmpp-main-monero-observer-contact/). 

Say hi, send feedback, questions, stories or [community messages](/tag/community) to the XMPP address below:

*Thank you for contributing, I really appreciate the support! Private messages and tips are pretty much the best way to let me know someone is reading and finds my work helpful, as I don't ever intend to add any sort of analytics to the site.*
