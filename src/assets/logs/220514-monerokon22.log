Invoices for community approval (DR)
Arroz Estudios Invoice #2
monerokon-tg
[telegram] <franciscom0301>Hello all, following the meeting from the beach ;)
ajs_
any update on this
midipoet
Arroz have provided us an overview of the nighttime schedule: https://cryptpad.disroot.org/file/#/2/file/5D6zCom0EaQxqrCzuSXX87Pv/
they have yet to specify which artists will be playing at what time though. they have confirmed that they will supply artists, all equipment, and drinks for the artists at the price quoted. 
i still think we should wait for a new invoice that specifies this
ajs_
they offered some DJs for us to confirm
deedledea[m]
yeah I agree to wait for the specified invoice to be sure, the devil is always in the details and we haven‚Äôt confirmed DJs yet
monerokon-tg
[telegram] <franciscom0301>So we don't need to contract any artist?
ajs_
Joe Delon and Chima Hiro
Chima has done a boiler room and Joe played Panorama bar
deedledea[m]
from what I saw they both seem legit and would be good choices imo
ajs_
I also would like to know how many people are we expecting from Arroz and if there would be crowd control for the after party?
msvb-web
Eight hundred euros worth of people?
midipoet
ajs_: i think these are valid questions, that should be ironed out
msvb-web: also a valid question
it may be worth trying to invite the venue event managers/owners to the meeting on Wednesday to discuss
msvb-web
So we ask 
gramsdb and 
HuiChi Man to get specifics on the second Arroz invoice about who are the artists that cost 2K and how many Arroz staff are paid by the 800 EUR bill. And if they are trained for crowd control.
midipoet
msvb-web: yes. makes sense ^ @manhuichi and @gramsdb
ajs_
okay we can table this invoice until we get more info
Hepsiburada #2
this includes HDMI switchers, splinters, additional cables, mini PC for presenter, table, gaffer tape, super glue, double sided tape
total ~447 EUR
msvb-web
That's a good invoice, a lot of things we need and thanks to ajs_ for choosing them for us.
midipoet
yes, thanks again ajs_ for being so on top of a/v
deedledea[m]
+1 for approval over here
midipoet
+1
msvb-web
Yes.
ajs_
ZED invoice - Screening "DISAPPEAR: COVER YOUR ONLINE TRACKS"
https://monerokon.com/pages/screening
400 EUR for permission to screen documentary one time
msvb-web
Good film, I'm watching it right now on Arte.
midipoet
i approve this, but worry about where we will find the time to show it
(as the schedule is packed)
could we wait until we finalise the schedule?
msvb-web
That makes sense, and pay it next week instead.
Is there any reason delay of the payment would be a problem ajs_[m]?
ajs_
i have been in contact with director and he has agreed to do an interview
Marc Meillassoux
over Jitsi
msvb-web
That means we really need to find an hour or two for the film.
Seems quite important.
ajs_
can be after talks
shouldn't be an issue to delay payment one week
deedledea[m]
screening at dusk with drinks?
midipoet
potentially end of day Saturday (provided we have time before night time setup)
msvb-web
The film is about one hour twenty minutes when showed on Arte, plus the time that Marc speaks.
ajs_
okay, so if we can fit it in... vote on invoice
midipoet
+1 (approve)
msvb-web
Assuming the schedule supports it then we should show the film and the invoice should be paid. Yes.
deedledea[m]
+1 if we can fit it in
ajs_
Berci invoice
banners
https://monerokon.com/pages/sample-banners
midipoet
+1 (approve)
(who are cicada bank though)?
msvb-web
They are the only 1.5K sponsor we have midipoet.
midipoet
msvb-web: understood
msvb-web
I approve the Berci invoice.
ajs_
i am think 2 main stage banners for tier 1 sponsors, 2 roll up banners for all sponsors (one near registration table, one near warehouse entrance), and two monero flag banners placed around outside
okay
deedledea[m]
+1 approve for the banners
ajs_
Update on venue requirements q list (G+H)
midipoet
the only major update from this, is that we have made a reservation for the speakers dinner - at https://casadoalentejo.pt/ on the Saturday evening
i am not sure who recommended that restaurant though - i hope it is nice. they have vegan/vegetarian options
monerokon-tg
[telegram] <franciscom0301>Nice üëç (re @xmr_events_bot: (irc) midipoet the only major update from this, is that we have made a reservation for the speakers dinner - at https://casadoalentejo.pt/ on the Saturday evening)
[telegram] <franciscom0301>It was me ;) (re @xmr_events_bot: (irc) midipoet i am not sure who recommended that restaurant though - i hope it is nice. they have vegan/vegetarian options)
midipoet
we are also sourcing a van to bring people to and from the speakers dinner venue
all other items are WIP
ajs_
CfP status (ajs/all)
I've published batch 3 votes
midipoet
we need to have the second committee meeting for CfP decisions
and to finalise schedule
ajs_
we need to confirm presentations ASAP
i have been getting emails from people asking for confirmation
midipoet
can we meet after this meeting (or Monday sometime?)
deedledea[m]
only midipoet and I were there earlier and we didn‚Äôt have the results so we had to postpone decisions
tomorrow works better for me if possible or I can send my comments in if I can‚Äôt make it
midipoet
can we try 18 UTC Monday?
ajs_
i am available 
midipoet
ok. lets try then
ajs_
Sponsor updates (all)
deedledea[m]
I can join at 18:30 UTC so start without me
midipoet
(with the goal of finalising either way tomorrow)
ajs_
DR has sent out invoices
I have received logos from all sponsors and will have banners printed next week
msvb-web
The card section 'Sponsor graphics' was left empty and moved to 'Done' on the cryptpad. That means there will be no logos printed on merchandise. Which is my preference anyway. Please object or complain now if something else is expected.
ajs_
No sponsor logos on merch
Inside banners and swag items (G+H/msvb)
which brings us to the next issue... merch
msvb-web
Merchandise design (of fifteen products) is almost 90% finished. Orders have reached 75%.
midipoet
msvb-web: great work!
msvb-web
So we are on time to receive all or nearly all merchandise on schedule and on budget for the conference.
This means we will own 100 pieces of the following set called 'Merchpack STD': tshirt, bucket hat, cotton socks, carrying bag, lanyard, shoelaces, patch, screen cleaner, inkpen, USB drive, bandana, tattoo, cold storage, party wristband, plastic bottle.
The only thing I'm worried about are the logistics of receiving at the warehouse, like if a signature is needed or import duty payment.
Are there any questions about merchandise? If not, then go to the next topic.
monerokon-tg
[telegram] <manhuichi>Portugal are very slow with customs if coming outside EU
msvb-web
That is a concern 
HuiChi Man, and that's what I mean by 'receiving problems'. Like if a border control decides to keep a set of boxes in their office for three weeks before informing us they need information.
midipoet
msvb-web: can we route via a different country (mitigating this risk somewhat?)
monerokon-tg
[telegram] <manhuichi>That is not unusual to happen. Even after payment of 23% vat they are a bit slow.
msvb-web
Only if a person with transportation from that country does a lot of logistics work. And almost all the Monero community has abandoned their obligations (this conference) so I doubt that we will get that level of help midipoet.
Germany is faster than Portugal, but agencies are much less honest in Germany than Portugual.
In case the people from Leipzig who are driving to Lisboa wanted to help, I mean.
ajs_
the proxy store people are based in Leipzig and they will be coming to monerokon
i could ask if they could help with logistics
msvb-web
If I get the message (together with a mailing address) that merchandise should be rerouted from the Lisboa warehouse to Proxy Store, then I will use the address.
monerokon-tg
[telegram] <manhuichi>100 swag items will be a good few boxes make sure to communicate that first
msvb-web
Remember there are problems with honesty in many Germany agencies, so this may not be an advantage to reroute.
ajs_
true
maybe we should just keep it simple and hope for the best
msvb-web
About 3000 swag items, due to backup plans for all 15 items purchased in 100 packs.
I think we should keep it simple and hope for the best.
ajs_
we are almost in time
so we can talk more about this after the meeting
msvb-web
Next topic: Food trucks.
ajs_
Food-trucks (G+H)
midipoet
Agenda items. 7-9 have no major updates that i know of
monerokon-tg
[telegram] <manhuichi>Is there any possible way to ship what you have completed next week and the rest at a later date? 2 weeks to clear customs should be expected
ajs_
okay
AOB
msvb-web
HuiChi Man: I don't understand the question. We are shipping as soon as possible on all items using the most expensive and fastest services.
monerokon-tg
[telegram] <manhuichi>What is the eta?
midipoet
just a quick update - we are working on getting a Monero ATM on site for the conference. it is looking like it will happen, and it will NFC compatible. 
*it will be NFC compatible
msvb-web
You mean 'what is the estimated time of arrival for the three thousand items?' Nobody knows this.
monerokon-tg
[telegram] <manhuichi>Can you ship the 75% completed items now?
msvb-web
We may have custom firmware produced for us as well midipoet, because typical BATMs lack a number of NFC standards.
HuiChi Man: Every merchandise item that has been manufactured is already on the way to the warehouse.
ajs_
Confirm next meeting time and date.... same time, same day 21st May
msvb-web
The 75% level corresponds with orders after negotiations conclude and design is accepted. That doesn't mean that 75% of items have been manufactured. In fact, most manufacturing is only starting now.
ajs_
Okay, so that concludes today's meeting. thank you.
